set of boxes we've got at Royalton Ravine, which still have last<br/>
summer's Record Holder stamps from the It's a WNY-ld Ride gathering.<br/>
I'm also planning on moving the last boxes from the series (Hot Baths,<br/>
Anime Babes and Ivy) to a different location so no one has to climb<br/>
that huge hill anymore to get to it. I'm pretty sure they'll be out of<br/>
the park entirely (thinking Williamsville in a month or so or UB this<br/>
weekend).<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone wants to get those or any of the summer stamps before<br/>
they go away (or just an exchange), I'll be there starting at 11 AM.<br/>
Some of my students are coming with their parents, so you can get a<br/>
few other exchanges as well. No matter what, wear clothes you don't<br/>
care about and hiking boots...it'll be MIGHTY muddy and nasty out there! <br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to both the regular permanent boxes (SOME of which are<br/>
leaving): <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=1814" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=1814</a><br/>
<br/>
and the extra stamps (ALL of which are leaving):<br/>

<br/>
PLEASE contact me ahead of time if you plan on being out there so I<br/>
know to wait for you!<br/>
