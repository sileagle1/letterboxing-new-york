</span></blockquote>Thank you so much, Buggylou! As a matter of fact, I just posted my <br/>
100th plant today. It was accomplished not without a lot of <br/>
scrambling!  You see, my goal was to plant 100 traditional <br/>
letterboxes..no hitchhikers, personal stamps, PLB's, cooties, etc. <br/>
included in this 100. (Although I do have some of those out there,too!) <br/>
The 100 boxes each had to have a handcarved stamp carved by me only. <br/>
Each had to be planted by me as well. I thought I had hit the 100 mark <br/>
a few days ago only to realize that one of my boxes was actually <br/>
planted for me by Sprite..so I didn't count it. Did I mention that I <br/>
wanted to accomplish this goal in 6 months? *grin*  I made it, with a <br/>
few weeks to spare. WHEW!<br/>
<br/>
But the best part to me is that out of these 100 boxes, 68 are planted <br/>
in unique areas...meaning that the majority of them are not <br/>
series....but individual places to visit. I has SUCH a blast going to <br/>
all these cool places..and I hope my fellow boxers will too. The <br/>
majority of them are planted in Onondaga County, and it is my aim that <br/>
people will visit this beautiful area and enjoy it as I do. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your offer of congratulations. I would especially <br/>
like to thank Catbead, my letterboxing mentor..who taught me much about <br/>
carving and especially planting.  Now it's time for me to do <br/>
maintenance and replace those earlier boxes that went missing! LOL<br/>
