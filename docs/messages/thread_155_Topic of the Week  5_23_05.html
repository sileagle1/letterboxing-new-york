<br/>
Here's this week's topic:<br/>
<br/>
************************************<br/>
TOPIC OF THE WEEK<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading in the logbook of one of my boxes where someone
discovered the box, was so taken with the idea that they went home,
researched it, got a stamp &amp; logbook then came back and stamped
in.  It was thrilling when I read it, has it ever happened to
anyone else?<br/>

it in a "If you're going to New England... here are some fun things to <br/>
try" Thought it sounded really cool. Went and checked out the <br/>
letterboxing.org website and saw that there were actually boxes where <br/>
we were going for vacation.<br/>
<br/>
We did our first one outside Madison, WI. Found the box open and <br/>
plastic bags strewn around but no stamp. (Had we known what to look <br/>
for we would have probably tried to find everything for the box). Then <br/>
we went to Marinette, MI and round the Red Arrow Park box. We didn't <br/>
have a stamp or anything just found the box opened it up and <br/>
thought "Oh my god how cool". <br/>
<br/>
We went immediately to Walmart bought a stamp, inkpad, and card stock <br/>
and went back to log in. <br/>
<br/>
I spent 2 hours the next day at the library researching other boxes in <br/>
that area and we went out hunting. We haven't stopped since. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-989798031">Well, technically, WE did that. We actually researched a little online, but<br/>
didn't believe it. So, after a day at the doctor (the one who would later<br/>
inspire "Faith, Hope &amp; Patience"!), we decided to cheer up by going to see<br/>
if this really existed. We found the Elba Onions' first few plants and were<br/>
first finders at 2 of them, as WELL as found 2 HH's! We didn't have a stamp<br/>
or anything, so we booked it to the store that week, bought ink, carved a<br/>
stamp and came back that weekend to stamp in!<br/>
