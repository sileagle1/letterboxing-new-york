sightseeing, part fun for the heck of it .... The Hudson Valley has so many 
historical places... unfortunately, many of them are either now smack dab 
in the middle of a city, or fun-policed by NPS,  but where we 
can, we've placed boxes at historical sites, such as Mt. Beacon, the location of 
a fire tower that played a crucial part in the Revolutionary War.  (how's 
that for a run on sentence :)</font></div>

TOPIC OF THE WEEK(S):<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How did you first learn about letterboxing? 11/21/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>On Livejournal (www.livejournal.com).  A friend of mine posted in her<br/>
'blog about this cool hobby she had found but hadn't yet tried out.  I<br/>
followed the link back to the LbNA website and tried it.  When I went<br/>
out to visit her several months later, I got her hooked on it. :D<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So far what is the most unique letterbox you have found? 11/28/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>The Kimball Library box.  Most of the others have been straightforward<br/>
directions.  The Kimball box has been the most intense puzzle box that<br/>
I've solved to date.  I vow to do my own puzzle box sometime.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This was recently on the newboxers list and generated a lot of<br/>
&gt; discussion. When do you think a boxer moves from 'newbie' to a more<br/>
&gt; seasoned 'oldie'?  12/05/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>When this first came out, I joking referenced that the cut-off date<br/>
was 18 months, making me the only local 'oldie' at the WNY gathering.<br/>
:D Seriously, I think it's the first time you think, "What the?..<br/>
Okay, it's the same as ..." the moment when you draw on a previous<br/>
letterboxing experience to walk through a new puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How did you come up with your trail name and stamp? 12/12/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Dagonell the Pirate is my SCA persona. The SCA (www.sca.org) is a<br/>
hobby organization for people interested in the re-enacting history.<br/>
I've read pretty much every book in Buffalo on pirates. :D  My stamp<br/>
is pirate-themed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you come up with the names for your boxes? 12/19/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>They're themed on either the stamp I've carved or the place I've<br/>
hidden them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Other than Rubbermaid, what other types of containers are used for<br/>
&gt; hiding letterboxes? 12/26/04<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>I have found film canisters but haven't used them yet.  The new<br/>
Taster's Choice coffee jars are perfect, but I don't like their<br/>
coffee, so I'll have to continue pulling them out of the recycle bins.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Camouflaged boxes. Have you found any? Do you create them, and how<br/>
&gt; do you do it? 01/02/05<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Found any, no.  Created any, not yet.  One I'm simply going to paint<br/>
jet black so it blends in.  Another is ... well, let's just say I'm<br/>
inspired by Poe's "Purloined Letter" or the movie "Hide in Plain<br/>
Sight". :D<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you tuck in your backpack? 01/09/05<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Letterbox clues, ink pad, personal stamp, colored pencils, magic<br/>
markers, compass, map, hitchhikers, spare baggies, water bottle. <br/>
Stuff like driving directions, first-aid kit, and fire extinguisher<br/>
get left in the car when I park.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now that winter's here do you plan to do much boxing? Have any tips<br/>
&gt; to share for disguising your tracks leading over to the box? <br/>
&gt; 01/17/05<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>I tried in mid-January.  The sun sets too early to make full days of<br/>
it. I used yellow water in a squirt bottle to disguise my purpose. :D<br/>
 Going the day before a large snowfall helps too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm spending my time, designing my stamps and clues.  I'm planning a<br/>
series along the Chautauqua Rails to Trails property, 30 miles of<br/>
trail to hide multiple boxes in, and I have permission from the trail<br/>
manager to 'GO FOR IT!'<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What's your favorite boxing experience? 01/24/05<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>The Eternal Flame.  Earth, air, fire, and water all in one isolated<br/>
spot. Later this year, when it's warmer, I'm going back just to<br/>
meditate in that spot. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you tie history and letterboxing together? How do you do it? <br/>
&gt; 01/31/05<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>As often as possible.  Usually my clues contain the history of the<br/>
location, or the history of the topic of the stamp.<br/>
