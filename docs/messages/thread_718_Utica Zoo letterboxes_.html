<br/>
For those of you interested in the Utica Zoo letterboxes (series of<br/>
12), I wanted to let you know about some updates.  The Prehistoric<br/>
Pokilotherms box had disappeared last fall, around late September or<br/>
so.  The stamp in the Quilled Rodents box had cracked in half, but was<br/>
still usable, if you creatively used your imagination!  This Friday,<br/>
April 18, I will be replacing the entire PP box, and the stamp in the<br/>
QR box.  Thank you to those of you who have shown interest in visiting<br/>
and supporting the zoo!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there's a neat event planned at the Utica Zoo this<br/>
Saturday for Earth Day.  It's worth the trip to visit the zoo, get 12<br/>
stamps, and enjoy some Earth Day activities up at the zoo!  I hope<br/>
some of you can make it!<br/>
<br/>
I've got the boxes listed on both Atlas Quest and LB.org but I think<br/>
the clues are easier to read on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks~<br/>
