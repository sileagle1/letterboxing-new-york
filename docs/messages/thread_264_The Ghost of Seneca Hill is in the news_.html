big article about local haunted places and Seneca Hill is listed! <br/>
That's her! If you want to hear about my personal encounter with her, <br/>
you'll have to find the box...if you haven't already, that is.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see that so many folks have been out boxing over the past week <br/>
or so. It's been so hot that it's hard to get out and get motivated! I <br/>
think my boxes have seen more traffic in the last week than most of <br/>
them got all of last summer!<br/>
<br/>
The Wizards of Oz will be out letterboxing tonight! Perhaps you'll run <br/>
into us!<br/>
