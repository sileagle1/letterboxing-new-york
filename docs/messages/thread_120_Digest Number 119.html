It was inside a hollow tree; up inside it.  You had to really stick your<br/>
arm in and up.  It was another one of those "Why didn't I bring my<br/>
gloves!"  So of course I made my daughter stick her arm in it; after<br/>
all, Lonesome Train didn't bother her in the least - I'm the squeamish<br/>
one.<br/>

I went to my first of the year this past Sunday near Buffalo, NY. It was<br/>
<br/>
a mini-gathering to wish well Team Dakota, who has moved out of state. <br/>
The Sprite and Highlander organized the event, and I think about 15 of <br/>
us gathered together for brunch and exchanges and conversation.<br/>

As a matter of fact, I went to one this weekend!  Sprite and<br/>
Highlander organized the "T.G.F.T.D. Mini-meet" (Thank Ghod For Team<br/>
Dakota) to honor a letter-boxing family that has recently left the<br/>
area.  After a hot breakfast and and several exchanges, I hit the<br/>
trails.<br/>
<br/>
Cup of Joe: Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Lonesome Train: Alive and well.  A brilliant hide, I almost missed it.<br/>
<br/>
Erie Passage: Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Squirrel's Treat: Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Whoooo's There?: Alive and well, replaced torn baggie.  Another<br/>
brilliant hide!<br/>
<br/>
What a Drag!: Status Unknown.  When I got to the site, another couple<br/>
was there taking pictures.  I asked "By any chance are you<br/>
letterboxing?"  They replied "No, but you're too late, the other team<br/>
got here first."  I responded that it wasn't that kind of a contest, I<br/>
didn't have to be the first one there, I just had to sign in. The guy<br/>
answered "You're not going to be able to sign in, the other team took<br/>
the tupperware box with them."  It was the word 'tupperware' that<br/>
filled me with dread.  I searched the location and couldn't find the<br/>
box.  I decided that they had taken the box, so the couple wouldn't<br/>
walk off with it, so I came back after I had found all the other boxes<br/>
in the area, but it still wasn't there.  I can only assume it was<br/>
another boxer from the mini-meet.  The couple said it was a white<br/>
mini-van.  Anyone have any idea who this might be?<br/>
<br/>
Drew the Cary Tree: Probably gone.  There was a storm in the area<br/>
April 2-3.  A lot of trees and power lines got knocked down.  When I<br/>
got to the site, it looked like a bomb hit it.  When I walked in the<br/>
gate, I saw that the maintenance crew had logged and stacked several<br/>
fallen trees.  When I saw that one log was hollow, I got a really bad<br/>
feeling.  I followed the clues which led me right to a tree stump.  No<br/>
box.  I went over to the stack of logs and searched in case the crew<br/>
hadn't noticed the box.  No box.  I checked the other stacks of logs.<br/>
 No box.  I went over to the trash barrel and discovered it was well<br/>
used by considerate dog-owners (work on it! :D)  I didn't go digging,<br/>
but I couldn't see anything that looked like tupperware either and I<br/>
could see pretty much everything in the barrel.  This one may be gone!<br/>
<br/>
Lost Nearby: Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Food Lion: Enlighten???  Enlighten!!!  Another brilliant hide!  Alive<br/>
and well.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for revealing an indication of where Drew the Cary Tree<br/>
may (be/have been) hidden, but I truly believe that it's gone, and I'm<br/>
hoping that a previous finder can verify this.  I've gone over my<br/>
sit-rep and made sure that there are no clues to locations in any of<br/>
the other boxes.  And yes, I'm aware that you won't be able to get<br/>
clues to all of these boxes on either Atlasquest or LBNA, I consider<br/>
that to be part of the game.<br/>
