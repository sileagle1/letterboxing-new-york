(with the cloth that goes over the shoulder and all),<br/>
so we were hoping to find a wee kilt that would cost<br/>
less than what we paid for the great kilt...not seeing<br/>
that yet!<br/>

Maybe we ought to just go with some tablecloth and<br/>
attitude, hmm? (already preparing for the backlash<br/>
she's about to get from the Highlander and every other<br/>
Scot-Irishman on this one!)<br/>

Then again, with what I plan to pay for a new set of<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1497442735">I agree. Price wise, kilts are the male equivalent of a corset. Any <br/>
woman who has worn a corset knows the difference between the <br/>
cheap "corsets" found at Frederick's and the REAL thing. A kilt, like <br/>
a corset, should be something that you save up for and treat <br/>
yourself. You will NOT be disappointed...trust me.<br/>
<br/>
As for that link (<a href="http://sporrans.com/skunkfulultimate.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sporrans.com/skunkfulultimate.html)</a>, Lisa?  <br/>
Let's say I am horrified but then again..with some thought...not at <br/>
all surprised. Humans have been borrowing the beauty of animals to <br/>
supplement their own perceived worthlessness for centuries. At least <br/>
they recognize beauty when they see it. The skunk one really is going <br/>
a little far though, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me when I was little. My Roman Catholic father, after much <br/>
protest, allowed my Presbyterian mother to start taking our family to <br/>
her home church. Our assigned family pew was directly behind this <br/>
woman who always proudly wore her real fox cape. This consisted of <br/>
many FULL fox pelts sewn together. And when I say FULL...I mean FULL. <br/>
Paws, heads..the whole works. The beautiful tails framed her face <br/>
which meant the HEADS draped down her back...right at a child's eye <br/>
level. Being an animal lover...who felt closer to animals than humans <br/>
half the time...you can imagine my horror at being forced to sit <br/>
directly behind this woman. I could barely concentrate on prayers, <br/>
sermons, hymns or anything, and I remember once bursting into tears <br/>
as the minister talked about loving all of God's creatures. My mother <br/>
took me by my hand and led me out of services that day and I was <br/>
amazed when I arrived the next Sunday to see the woman in a beautiful <br/>
maroon velvet coat with elaborate black braid trimming. She smiled at <br/>
me and squeezed my hand but never said a word and my mother never <br/>
spoke another word about it either. God, I miss my mom.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Personally, I think the bobcat one is truly awful. If you've ever <br/>
seen one of these creatures and their amazing paws.... It just seems <br/>
disgusting to me to use their head and paws as a purse to cover your <br/>
dick. Sorry for my bluntness, but there it is.<br/>
<br/>
Even sorrier is this direct quote from the website: <br/>
<br/>
"With the kilt, a sporran is a real necessity. You have to have some <br/>
place to put whatever you usually carry in your pants pockets. The <br/>
only sporran that will serve for all occasions is the fur sporran <br/>
with the animal's head made into the flap that closes it. These <br/>
animal-mask sporrans are very expensive (all but the plainest leather <br/>
sporrans are) and hard to get, since badgers and otters are now <br/>
protected (in Scotland), though I understand the sporran makers are <br/>
importing badger skins from Texas. Someone should get into the <br/>
business over here."<br/>

it!  It does drive me nuts to see men wearing "knee socks" with <br/>
their kilts, instead of the proper kilt hose.  I believe they are <br/>
called trews, but I probably spelled that wrong.  I haven't got <br/>
around to knitting any yet, but I beleive I have a pattern in one of <br/>
my other sock books!<br/>
<br/>
On a different kilt note, I was at a wedding with a bagpiper and was <br/>
glad that he chose an undergarment, although not thrilled it was a <br/>
pair of white y-fronts.  Men don't tend to know how to pick stuff up <br/>
off the ground when wearing a "skirt."  I was right behind him!  <br/>
Those things can be short, especially if the guy is a little round!<br/>
<br/>
And I do agree with Lock Wench and lisascenic that a kilt is <br/>
something to save up for.  You definately want it to be well made <br/>
from the best materials (i.e. wool: don't even talk to me about <br/>
acrylic kilts!) and as a fiber artist I can tell you that that does <br/>
cost.  If your plaid is harder to get, you may even be paying a <br/>
cottage industry weaving studio.  Skilled labor is an expensive, <br/>
dying art.  Sometimes I think the only folks still getting by on it <br/>
are a few carpenters and autobody workers.  <br/>

p.s. I speak for Rusty when I suggest that real dead bunny on the <br/>
sporin is not the same sort of luxury as real wool.  There are some <br/>
really nice fake furs out there!<br/>

&gt; I don't think that "cheap" and "kilt" can be combined in any<br/>
&gt; meaningful way.  If you figure that you're purchasing between four <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; eight yards of very specialized fabric, a kilt buyer should expect <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; spend some time saving for this purchase.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And then there are all the lovely accesories.....<br/>

&gt; I'm sure Knitica could advise on the traditional socks.<br/>

under<br/>
