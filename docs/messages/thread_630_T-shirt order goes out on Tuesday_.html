the Highlander is taking the t-shirt order in to Planet Love Designs on <br/>
Tuesday, which should give you last few folks a chance to send your <br/>
payments in. We cannot afford to purchase any extras, folks, so if you <br/>
still owe us money by Tuesday, we'll have to take your shirts off the <br/>
list and let you try again the next time we're able to make the minimum <br/>
order (25 shirts). Don't forget...$11 per shirt, $4.05 if you want it <br/>
mailed to you, $8.10 if you need a box instead of the flat rate <br/>
envelope.<br/>
<br/>
We'll post a bulletin when the shirts come in...thanks again!<br/>
