<br/>
Well, summer has unofficially made its grand exit, with the kids<br/>
here in ON and NY returning to school tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
That also means that we're less than 4 weeks away from our Box ON!<br/>
gathering here in Belleville.<br/>
<br/>
I have had notes from a few boxers having to bow out of attending<br/>
for various reasons, so if possible, I'd like to get an update as to<br/>
whether you're planning on attending, or even thinking about it, so<br/>
I can better forecast attendance, food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, this still promises to be a more intimate gathering than<br/>
most...perfect for first timers and more experienced boxers alike.<br/>
<br/>
So, please drop us a line, either here or privately, and for those<br/>
on AQ, please update your intent on the events calendar.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon, Jiggs</div>

<br/>
Things are coming together now (finally!)<br/>
<br/>
I now have 5 of the 7 Box ON! series boxes, with the Niagara Region <br/>
box on its way, and hopefully the Ottawa region box right behind it!<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Jiggs relented and has carved a super Event stamp - trust me, <br/>
you wont be disappointed!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like we will have about 25 to 35 folks stopping by. For all <br/>
you newer boxers, you are certainly very welcome to join us! I will <br/>
be remaining at the pavillion for the day. My 2 Jigglets will be <br/>
there as well ( girls, 12 and 9) so dont be afraid to bring your <br/>
kids or Sig Others along!<br/>
<br/>
A reminder...if you want to get Norasta's boxes..DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! <br/>
he he <br/>
<br/>
If you hven't signed up for the potluck. please do so. I've listed <br/>
some items already. please feel free to contribute what you want. <br/>
Just let me know so we can cut down on duplication.<br/>
<br/>
For those that have contributed boxes, please let me know again if <br/>
you want the boxes returned after the event.<br/>
<br/>
See you Saturday!<br/>
