gathering and I just wanted to let everyone know about a great box 1/2<br/>
hr. North of Ithaca, No it's not one of mine, Check out LbNA for<br/>
Think Outside the Letterbox it was planted by Jelly Bean and it is the<br/>
most creative clue I have ever solved. It is in Watkins Glenn State<br/>
Park which is beautiful in it's own right. Be warned it is about a two<br/>
mile hike total and it took me two attempts plus about two hours of<br/>
thinking to find this bad boy but whenn I found it I could have kicked<br/>
myself. If anyone has time and inclination I highly recomend this<br/>
box. Hope to see Ya'll in Ithaca. If thingss work out right I'll be<br/>
down early Fri. to box all day and prolly stay awhile on sun. for more<br/>
boxes. Anyone intrested in meeting up on Sat. or Sun. let me know.<br/>
