Being someone who frequents Derby Hill at all times of the year, <br/>
I'll give you my take on the dog situation. Yes, they say dogs are <br/>
allowed as long as they behave. But....during the times of the year <br/>
when the raptor migration is in full swing, I wouldn't recommend it, <br/>
even though they allow it. Here's why: In the early spring months <br/>
that place is packed- I mean PACKED- with bird-watching folks. They <br/>
come in droves! They set up camp for the whole weekend and don't <br/>
budge! That parking area at the top of the hill will be completely <br/>
full! These are hardcore birdwatchers, and they're the kind of <br/>
people who might have a a problem with dogs. I just don't want to <br/>
risk them getting miffed at us letterboxers and start hurling boxes <br/>
into the lake.<br/>
<br/>
This time of year, if you want to get the Derby Hill boxes, you're <br/>
perfectly fine if you want to take the dogs (by the way Trailhoundz, <br/>
we're DYING TO MEET THEM!!!!) because it's deserted most of the <br/>
time. It's just the early spring months that I would avoid with the <br/>
dogs. <br/>
<br/>
MTNestRobin took her dog and I know they had no problem. <br/>

See you on the trails,<br/>
