I had the pleasure of meeting a bunch of you at the<br/>
Finger Lakes Gathering, and am still planning to get<br/>
out to Oswego soon -- sometime after the 19th,<br/>
when Chile Boy's camp ends.<br/>
<br/>
I've been working my way west and central to find<br/>
all the wonderful boxes you have planted, and hope<br/>
to see more of you in the Capital District.  If anyone<br/>
should wander out this way, please let me know.<br/>
I'm always game for an exchange, and maybe I can<br/>
work in a meal, too! :-) (Cooking for you, that is!)<br/>
<br/>
We've got a bunch of great boxes in our area now<br/>
(as opposed to about 8 this time a year ago), and <br/>
we're working on more...  Definitely worth the trip. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that I joined this list so late, but better late than<br/>
never!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting more of  you through <br/>
your boxes and/or in person!<br/>

I am soo glad they closed off the road as it has really brought the area back to a more pristine look. When the road used to be open there was all kinds of trash, broken glass and graffiti. It's so beautiful now though. Water level is very very low this time of year but it is gorgeous in the spring. My dad still lives within a mile of this box and I am eager to plant more boxes in my hometown of Ilion. My Russell Park series was done on the trail so the stamps are pretty simple but the memories for me make up for it.  Isn't LisaScenic's stamp great? I have another 2 boxes carved for that area but I have to get there first! My dad and I are heading west of Syracuse tomorrow so look for some boxes to be planted along the way.....</div>

I know!  When I went to post my find for that box, I saw that you were<br/>
there the next day. :-(  I didn't know that the Ilion/Herkimer/Little Falls<br/>
area was considered "your" side of the state, but it's certainly closer!<br/>
How far are you from that area?  We are about an hour.  I am planning<br/>
to go back there soon, as I didn't have Chile Boy with me, and he <br/>
definitely would love those Moss Island boxes.  Did  you also get to<br/>
Lockwench's series in Russell Park?  We ran out of time, so will try <br/>
those as well.  Now that I am on this list, I will post in the future when<br/>
I am heading out in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
(And I'll definitely let you know when we come to Oswego -- any days<br/>
you WON'T be around between 8/20 and 8/30? )<br/>
<br/>
I'm also hoping to get out to the WNY gathering!  <br/>
<br/>
See you soon!<br/>
