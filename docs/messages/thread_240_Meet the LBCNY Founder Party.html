this Saturday's party. Let me fill you in....<br/>
<br/>
Paul in SF is the founder of this group but moved to San Francisco. <br/>
He still has family in the Utica-Rome area (as well as letterboxes!) <br/>
so he periodically comes home to visit. He has graciously offered to <br/>
host a party this Sat at 1pm (along with his neices and nephews) in <br/>
Oriskany, NY.  All LBCNY boxers are welcome to come and swim, carve, <br/>
talk, exchange and box! He and his family are providing burgers, <br/>
hotdogs and soda...and the rest of us can bring a sidedish or dessert <br/>
to share. <br/>
<br/>
Paul really needs a headcount..so please RSVP to him directly at <br/>
<a href="mailto:pgonyea@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pgonyea@...</a>  so he can send you directions.  Looking <br/>
forward to seeing all LBCNY boxers and their families!  His original <br/>
post is included below...<br/>

"Since I'm making one of my rare appearances very soon, I'd like to <br/>
invite any interested LbCNY'ers to a casual meet-greet-stamp-exchange <br/>
backyard lunch in very central NY -- the rustic village of Oriskany, <br/>
NY, between Utica and Rome. <br/>
<br/>
** TIME: 1:00PM on SATURDAY, July 30 **<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing nieces and nephews will help host. We'll provide <br/>
soda, burgers, and hot dogs, and you bring a potluck dish, like a <br/>
salad or dessert. We have a really great swimming pool for you to <br/>
take a swim in as well. Well-behaved kids are welcome -- there are <br/>
kids of all ages around.<br/>
<br/>
RSVP directly to me, so we can plan. Directions will be provided by <br/>
return e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I think there will be one or two NEW boxes nearby by that time, and <br/>
if you haven't collected the Nettles and Namesake series, here's your <br/>
chance."</div>
