TurtleMCQ. Thanks to both of you for letting us tag along and helping <br/>
us find our way around the area. We'll definitely be back soon for <br/>
the boxes we missed!<br/>
<br/>
While on our trip, the Highlander and I, along with TurtleMcQ, <br/>
thought of an LB challenge to for all you Wegman's fans out there. <br/>
We'd like to see who can plant a box that'll stay the longest. If you <br/>
have a Wegman's in your area, you're eligible. If you'd like to <br/>
participate (or are interested in knowing the rules, contact us <br/>
offlist and we'll explain what we've got in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you soon...this promises to be fun AND sneaky! ;-)<br/>
