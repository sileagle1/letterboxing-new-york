ago and managed to pick up a colorful &amp; itchy souvenir as well as some<br/>

boxes, we're pretty sure that's where we got it.  We were careless and<br/>
didn't even think to look before rooting around in the leafy bushes. <br/>

you can develop an allergy to it.  Be careful!  Norasta</div>

Norastaa.  I got into something the other day while<br/>
planting Summer Thunder.  There was no poison ivy in<br/>
the area, but I ended up getting an allergic reaction<br/>
to something and had a pretty lumpy wrist for a few<br/>
hours. That was the same day Soccerchick sliced her<br/>
heel open playing in our sprinkler and ended up with 3<br/>
stitches, so it really wasn't our best day in the<br/>
great outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes for a speedy and itch-free recovery!<br/>
