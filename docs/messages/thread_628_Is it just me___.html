<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Seriously! Let's get some chat goin' on 
here!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What letterboxing have you done in any shape or 
form in the past week?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Let's hear from everybody! Newbies and lurkers, 
too! I wanna see some names here we dont' normally hear speaking 
up!</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just yesterday, I went into the southtowns of 
Buffalo, specifically Rushford, and did some boxin' with my dear Kitten without 
Mittens, and her mother, Falling Leaves. We picked up two boxes on the northern 
side of the Canadea damn, Lothelorian and Sunset View - Rushford . Both were 
great boxes, by the way- and what a view, the damn and the drained 
lake!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sadly, though, both Kitten and myself had to be 
back in Kenmore by 5:45ish, so we didn't get to stay and get more boxes- but 
never fear, we shall return.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to that, I've also nabbed a couple of 
virtual letterboxes a few nights back, and have one or two postals sitting 
around in my house as well.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We're also thinking of doing a trip to Zoar (I 
think that's how it's spelled) Valley, as well...from what I understand (or 
rather, the research Kitten's done on AQ on it! :D), there aren't any boxes down 
there! So, we're going to make up a couple each and plant them while we're 
there. On the other hand, I haven't introduced Kitten fully to LbNA, so perhaps 
there are boxes there we haven't seen yet :D</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So....let's hear it! What're you all up

<br/>
Ohhhh...are you going to plant a box based on the Clawfoot people????<br/>
I always thought that would be a way cool box. And you are<br/>
right...boxes are few and far between in that part of NY State. I have<br/>
a box sitting here that I carved for Lilydale over a year ago and I<br/>
STILL haven't planted it!!!!  ( anyone who wants this box is welcome<br/>
to it) It's carved, and already in a camo-ed Lock n Lock. Just email<br/>
me with your address and I will mail it to you! It can be YOUR<br/>
box..just carved by me...lol.<br/>
<br/>
I am about to post about our mini-gathering in CNY on Thanksgiving<br/>
weekend. EVERYONE is welcome to come, but we really would like you to<br/>
sign up by the 15th if you can, so we can give them an accurate head<br/>
count. Should be a lot of fun, and you can bring your non-boxing<br/>
relatives as well...<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Most people box all year unless the weather is just too bad, deep snow, heavy rain, or your basic east coast blizzard. Most people leave their boxes out all year. If the right containers are used, they survive the snow and rain but some might not be accessible in deep snow. Actually boxing in the brisk cold weather is a lot of fun. </font></div>

<div><font size="2">Saturday I *finally* went back to the Pine Barrens in Jersey to get the WOM box I had taken to the Boxtoberfest and forgotten. Sadly it was already vandalized and gone. I waited too long and it was too close to the pavillion area. My own fault for being so lazy. But I got one of the permanent boxes that was planted near the gathering and the Pine Barrens are a fasinating place, so it was worth the drive. And it was such a beautiful day! </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Some of my urban boxes need to replaced and are ready to go but I haven't done that. I'm afraid my hours at work are getting in the way of boxing these days. But I have the week after Thanksgiving off and plan to make up for lost time. </font></div>
