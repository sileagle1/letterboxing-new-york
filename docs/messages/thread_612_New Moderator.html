there will be a new moderator for this board. I took this duty over<br/>
for Catbead, who had generously offered to handle the moderator duties<br/>
after  our founder, Paul in SF, had moved to California. Paul is from<br/>
Oriskany and was instrumental in getting boxing off the ground in<br/>
upstate New York.  He still makes an annual pilgrimage so many of you<br/>
may get a chance to meet him in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Catbead took on the duty for quite a while, and then I took over for<br/>
her when she needed a break. Celtic Quinn has generously offered to<br/>
take over for ME, as I have recently begun a new job and I am also<br/>
planning to begin graduate courses at some point. His duties will<br/>
begin once he has reliable power again, as the Buffalo area was really<br/>
socked with some damage from that last storm.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I have kept the list talking, for a list such as this dies when<br/>
there is no discussion. Many of you now know I am a person full of<br/>
opinions, but I enjoy hearing others' opinions as I learn so much and<br/>
have adjusted my own outlook after hearing of your experiences. So<br/>
thank you for taking the time to post and thank you for putting<br/>
yourself "out there."  It's also been a great place to promote New<br/>
York boxing events, and we now have 4 annual gatherings in the<br/>
state...with many more mini-gatherings popping up. It has been my<br/>
intention to help connect all the little pockets of New York boxing,<br/>
and make this board a safe and respectful place to discuss boxing<br/>
issues while still maintaining and  nurturing close friendships.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue to post from time to time, but it may not be the full<br/>
length novels you have come to expect from me...lol.  Thanks again,<br/>
everyone...and let's help Celtic Quinn in his new position as<br/>
moderator! I am sure he will develop a style and demeanor all his own.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for moderating this board.  I rarely post but I always read <br/>
it; I don't always agree but I enjoy all the opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck in your new job<br/>
