decided to post a little WNY action! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
FINALLY had a day of boxing with just the Highlander and I! I get so <br/>
caught up asking others to box with us that I had forgotten what it <br/>
was like to just be out together doing what we love...walking and <br/>
talking in the autumn splendor while searching for boxes. The <br/>
Highlander's neck problems have abated considerably, so he finally <br/>
got to enjoy a day of hiking, too.<br/>
<br/>
Rochester is really a nice place (regardless of what the Buffalo <br/>
snobs may say!). We LOVED the Urban Letterboxer's Eastman School of <br/>
Music series, one of which was another book hidden like our <br/>
Letterbook box. Unfortunately, out of the 8 boxes we tried, 3 were <br/>
missing/couldn't be found, and one just got too dark (thank goodness <br/>
for the Highlander in dark scary places at night! Still, it was a <br/>
terrific day...not too hot, not too cold, not too long or short a <br/>
walk, everything just right! I swear, we're not boxing with ANYone <br/>
else for at least a month, just so we can hang out with each other <br/>
all over again! I think we'll also start boxing earlier in the <br/>
day...I love sleeping in, but on a boxing day, it just seems a shame <br/>
to sleep away those extra hours.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I could just get my PLB going, my boxing life would be <br/>
easy! :-P<br/>

Durand Eastman Park and found 10 out of 10 I planned to find. Wasn't it
a beautiful afternoon ... mild, windy, whitecaps on Lake Ontario. I'm
down to your Monopoly Series and two I tried earlier in the week but
couldn't find. One of the two I've puzzled over twice this week and the
series it belongs with is incomplete without it it. Maybe back again
tomorrow.<br/>

<div>Went to the Boxtoberfest in Cherry Hill with H &amp; H. Saw some people I hadn't seen since the one letterboxingbee did last year in Palmyra. It was a really nice day. A bunch of us drove into town and got a couple of boxes there. It's a pretty little town. Miz Scarlett put a Ladies Only box in the ladies room by the pavillion. lol It was a good day. </div>

<div>Went to the Boxtoberfest in Cherry Hill with H &amp; H. Saw some 
      people I hadn't seen since the one letterboxingbee did last year in 
      Palmyra. It was a really nice day. A bunch of us drove into town and got a 
      couple of boxes there. It's a pretty little town. Miz Scarlett put a 
      Ladies Only box in the ladies room by the pavillion. lol It was a good 
      day. </div>
<div>Home today to battle the ugly laundry monster.

<div><br/></div><font size="2"><tt>Never think to post an update, but today 
        was so nice, we finally <br/>decided to post a little WNY action! 
        ;-)<br/><br/>FINALLY had a day of boxing with just the Highlander and I! I 
        get so <br/>caught up asking others to box with us that I had forgotten 
        what it <br/>was like to just be out together doing what we 
        love...walking and <br/>talking in the autumn splendor while searching 
        for boxes. The <br/>Highlander's neck problems have abated considerably, 
        so he finally <br/>got to enjoy a day of hiking, too.<br/><br/>Rochester is 
        really a nice place (regardless of what the Buffalo <br/>snobs may say!). 
        We LOVED the Urban Letterboxer's Eastman School of <br/>Music series, one 
        of which was another book hidden like our <br/>Letterbook box. 
        Unfortunately, out of the 8 boxes we tried, 3 were <br/>missing/couldn't 
        be found, and one just got too dark (thank goodness <br/>for the 
        Highlander in dark scary places at night! Still, it was a <br/>terrific 
        day...not too hot, not too cold, not too long or short a <br/>walk, 
        everything just right! I swear, we're not boxing with ANYone <br/>else 
        for at least a month, just so we can hang out with each other <br/>all 
        over again! I think we'll also start boxing earlier in the <br/>day...I 
        love sleeping in, but on a boxing day, it just seems a shame <br/>to 
        sleep away those extra hours.<br/><br/>Now, if I could just get my PLB 
        going, my boxing life would be <br/>easy! :-P<br/><br/>The (back in the 
        saddle again) Sprite &amp; the (loving the ride, but <br/>glad to be back 
        to the bunkhouse)

Would one of those boxes you've puzzled over be #2 by any chance? <br/>
Apparently, Ninja Rob found it on the day of the gathering.<br/>

&gt; Durand Eastman Park and found 10 out of 10 I planned to find. <br/>
Wasn't it <br/>
&gt; a beautiful afternoon ... mild, windy, whitecaps on Lake Ontario. <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; down to your Monopoly Series and two I tried earlier in the week <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; couldn't find. One of the two I've puzzled over twice this week and <br/>
the <br/>

again <br/>
&gt; tomorrow.<br/>
