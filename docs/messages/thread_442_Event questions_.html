<div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have some questions about the event coming up in February, so I thought I would ask...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. Will nametags be provided? My greyhounds will not be attending (I don't think the Skyview Lodge allows them in, plus Lucy would probably kill me in my sleep for bringing her on a 5 hour "hike" in the cold, ROFL!). HOWEVER, since they will not be attending, I am- <strong>(*corny alert! corney alert!*)</strong> making an iron-on TShirt that has their photo on it, as well as our team name- TRAILHOUNDZ- across it. So people will be able to identify me (and hopefully ask about my newly-posted personal traveller? LOL!). But I was wondering how I would be able to identify other people for exchanges, personal travelers, etc! Will people wear nametags?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. My other question- would it be possible for clues to be posted a few days before the event? So we can plan out what boxes are along what trails, what boxes to do in what order, etc.? I remember the Rochester event clues being posted a week or so beforehand, because I was able to print out a trail map, decide which boxes were on what trails and which to go to first, etc. Of course, then Lucy ran full-speed into the camper and I spent the day at the vet's office and not at the gathering... but it did make for nice pre-planning! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, those are my two questions. I can't wait for my FIRST event! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Trailhoundz</div>
<div>(who will be minus the "houndz")</div><pre>

post them ahead of time, usually that Wednesday or Thursday (or in <br/>

towners for your gathering, we'll be needing some of those early <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-90971127">Our local newspaper hides a medallion in one of our parks...and each <br/>
day posts a new clue in the paper. If you find it, it is worth $1,000 <br/>
and if you are a subscriber, it is worth $2,000. I actually called <br/>
the papers and told them I was having a scavenger hunt in Highland <br/>
Forest and asked if that would be a problem. They didn't tell me if <br/>
the medallion was hidden there but said our event was only on the <br/>
second day of clues and there wasn't much "action" that early. You <br/>
see, the clues get more and more specific as the hunt goes on.<br/>
<br/>
As for snow? I can't help you there, but Highland Forest is just as <br/>
fun for a hiker as a skier/snowshoer. :)<br/>
