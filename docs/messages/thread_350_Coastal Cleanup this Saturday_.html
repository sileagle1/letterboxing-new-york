Do you have an extra hour or two this Saturday?  Why not join the<br/>
International Coastal Cleanup?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Clean up your shores, clean up your streams.  Just show up, and the<br/>
organizers will put you to work.  <br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of trash in out waterways.<br/>
<br/>
In 2004, there were so many soda cans picked up that every resident of<br/>
Vermont could have had two.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the cigarette filters picked up (if stacked end to end)<br/>
would have stretched to the moon and back, twice.<br/>
