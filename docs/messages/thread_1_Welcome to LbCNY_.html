will make this come true:<br/>
<br/>
More Letterboxers = More Letterboxes = More Fun!<br/>
<br/>
Although I'm almost 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, I saw that <br/>
there WAS interest in letterboxing in the area, because within a day <br/>
or two of planting the 1st Oneida County letterboxes, people were <br/>
stamping in, and I began to receive e-mails thanking me for planting <br/>
the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you aren't waiting for me to return with more boxes... because <br/>
if you each plant a box or two or three, it's going to become much <br/>
more fun -- and quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly new to letterboxing myself, having started this past <br/>
spring. I jumped in, feet first, and started planting AND hunting at <br/>
the same time. The Northern California Letterboxing group dubbed <br/>
me "Rookie of the Year". When I began, there were only a total of 7 <br/>
boxes in the city of San Francisco itself. As I started planting <br/>
more, people joined in, and now there are over 30 boxes -- and all <br/>
within just a few months!<br/>
<br/>
The boxes I hid in NY are simple, and I was assisted by my great <br/>
nephews and their friends. Take a look at some of my notorious San <br/>
Francisco boxes (go to www.letterboxing.org and find the clues for my <br/>
Vertigo #1 box, based on the Hitchcock film, in San Francisco). That <br/>
was my first planted box. I get a lot of fun e-mails from people who <br/>
have hunted for that box and others. Another favorite is Nepenthe, <br/>
based on Greek mythology. If you come to SF, bring youre letterboxing <br/>
gear!<br/>
<br/>
The sky's the limit when it comes to creative ideas for letterboxes. <br/>
I now have what may have been the first underwater (yep! submerged) <br/>
letterbox, based on the theme of Atlantis. My "Yes, Noe!" box takes <br/>
you on a simple neighborhood garden tour, using only distorted photos <br/>
as clues. I'm now putting together a box that has less than 10 words <br/>
for clues (people joke that my clues are very word-y hahahaha!) <br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and plant a letterbox to share something that you find <br/>
interesting, special, or memorable with others -- and have fun doing <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
I have some excellent contacts who are very experienced letterboxers <br/>
and give great advice. If you have a question or need help, we'll get <br/>
you an answer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to have my niece, Deidre, join me as co-moderator for this <br/>
group -- she's local and lives in the "Place of the Nettles".<br/>

<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/star-crossed.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/star-crossed.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The 9 words in the box get people to the location in San Francisco, and the <br/>
rest are the specifics for where the box lies. I was content with my number <br/>
count, and people are able to find it, once they solve the words in the box.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun - now back to my long narrative style: <br/>

<br/>
Thanks to catbead/Libby for directing me to this group. I am new to <br/>
letterboxing but not to hiking in New York State. Just wanted to add <br/>
another dimension to my outdoor activity.<br/>
<br/>
I have begun placing boxes in the Syracuse area. Most will be a<br/>
series of boxes in one place to give people more discoveries in one <br/>
area. Check out The "Wonders of Onondaga Park" or I Never Strike Twice <br/>
in the Same Place? on www.letterboxing.org for my first boxes. I would <br/>
appreciate any feedback as I am still learning. Nice to "meet" you<br/>
all!<br/>
