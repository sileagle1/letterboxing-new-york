                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1137281592">Glad you enjoyed the day! We had fun planning it...all those <br/>
wonderful <br/>
stamps that kept coming in...thank you !!! Then, the fantastic <br/>
weather; <br/>
I beleieve it was the first Sunday in a month where there was no <br/>
rain. <br/>
The park was perfect with the fall colors! Finally and most <br/>
importantly, the people were fun to meet. It was the fastest event I <br/>
wever attended ("time flies....")<br/>
<br/>
The stamps are still up there so if you did not get them all and live <br/>
in the Albany area, you probably can get them.  There is no entrance <br/>
fee after Columbus day...!!!! So this weekend would be most <br/>
assured...I also no of some people making the trip back!<br/>
<br/>
If you know of some people that could not make it and need the clues, <br/>
feel free to copy them and share!<br/>

PS N&amp;G&amp;A: Thanks for the pics!<br/>
