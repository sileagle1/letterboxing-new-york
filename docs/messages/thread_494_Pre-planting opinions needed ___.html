                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-309513412">I agree with LW. Cemeteries can be really great places to plant as <br/>
long as it's done respectfully, and not near any graves, etc. We were <br/>
looking for a spot to hide the Seneca Hill Ghost letterbox and the <br/>
only area we could find was in a very old, historic cemetery. The <br/>
stones and mausoleums in that place are amazing! I love seeing old, <br/>
weathered stones and thinking about the interesting people that are <br/>
buried there. What kind of lives did they lead? Plus it really <br/>
increased the creepiness factor on the Seneca Hill Ghost letterbox!<br/>

I actually have one near a VERY VERY old grave site.  Here lies <br/>
Henry.  Strangely, I like to visit him (now) as an old friend &amp; talk <br/>
to him (Just to see how things are).  I thought LOOOOOOONG and hard <br/>
about it, but went with it.  You would understand if you see/found <br/>
the location of the box.  I say go for it :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Paul, I have several cemetary boxes (check my Taphophiles, Unite! <br/>
series). Taphophiles are admirers of cemetaries, tombstones, and the <br/>
like. I have used that method (guidence by tombstone inscriptions, <br/>
shape, etc) and it has worked very well. My "As the Crow Flies" is <br/>
also in a cemetary.  They are good places to hide boxes as no one <br/>
really bothers you and they make for nice peaceful walking. No wonder <br/>
people used to spend their weekends in cemetaries in the old days.<br/>
<br/>
Missing you muchly. Spoke to MtNestRobin the other day and she is up <br/>
for some boxing with us! When you coming back to NY?<br/>
