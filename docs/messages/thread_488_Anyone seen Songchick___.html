I'll contact you guys and maybe we could meet up if<br/>

How are you feeling by the way? :D<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-893865053">Hi, I just joined the group and am completely new to letterboxing.  I  <br/>
can't wait to start!  Let me introduce myself - my name is Nancy, I  <br/>
live in Putnam county, NY.  I work as a birth and postpartum doula,  <br/>
am married and have 4 kids, ages 8, 5, 5, (twins) and 3.<br/>
<br/>
Some basic questions - anyone else in this group near Putnam/Upper  <br/>
Westchester?  Would there be any boxes that this group (or any other  <br/>
group) would know about that would not be listed on the  <br/>
letterboxing.org website?  Also, How does someone go about getting  <br/>
permission to place boxes on state property, such as parks or  <br/>
historic places.  Where else could someone put one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for answering my questions, and sorry for my naivety!<br/>
