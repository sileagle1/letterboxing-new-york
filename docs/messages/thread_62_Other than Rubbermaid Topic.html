                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-629939002">I used a watertight plastic container from American Science Surplus <br/>
for my unique underwater Atlantis-themed box, which was in a <br/>
waterfall in Golden Gate Park (a temporary box - 2 months). I <br/>
planted it for our Golden Gate Gathering, and it was fun seeing the <br/>
faces on the people who found it as they returned to our picnic site.<br/>
<br/>
Should you attempt an underwater letterbox, here are some tips:<br/>
<br/>
I needed to use a heavy lead weight and monofilament line, because <br/>
being waterproof, the box floated like a bubble. The monofilament <br/>
was attached to the railing of a small bridge over the waterfall <br/>
using a clasp, and was barely visible and easily concealed. When <br/>
found, it could be pulled up out of the water, unclasped, and taken <br/>
to a nearby spot to stamp in. All of that worked fine.<br/>
<br/>
What didn't work:<br/>
<br/>
After staying perfectly dry for about a month, someone allowed some <br/>
sand or grit to get into the rubber seal, which allowed a small <br/>
amount of water to get inside. Even though the journal was in a <br/>
Ziploc bag, they didn't completely seal it, and it got damp and <br/>
spoiled. I added a note asking people to keep the seal clean in my <br/>
clues. I should have just put the stamp inside, with a laminated <br/>
note revealing a different, drier location for the journal in a <br/>
separate container nearby. <br/>
<br/>
Look at all the ponds, lakes, streams, canals, and rivers that grace <br/>
NY - they're letterboxing opportunities if carefully thought out and <br/>
tested!<br/>
