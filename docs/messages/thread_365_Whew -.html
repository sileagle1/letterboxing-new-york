lot harder than I thought! You see, I set myself a personal goal of <br/>
100  planted boxes in 6 months.  I wish I was a faster carver.  I am <br/>
afraid the snow will start falling before I am done! And there are only <br/>
3 weeks left in October! Can I do it?!?!<br/>
<br/>
My camping trip to the Adirondacks was so busy that I still have 2 <br/>
boxes ready to be planted there...but no time for another extended trip.<br/>
<br/>
So I started scouting out other closer areas and have managed to make 2 <br/>
more boxes ready to plant..leaving me with 4 more to carve. I went out <br/>
today with my topographical maps and some notes..determined to find 4 <br/>
more nice places. It was drizzly and cold..and I came home muddy and <br/>
covered in burrdocks..but I am happy to report that I found the places <br/>
I needed to make my goal! The Doug's Fish Fry dinner helped sustain me <br/>
too.  Now THERE is a clue to the area I was in!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my buddy, Catbead..I was able to buy a sheet of PZ Cut off of <br/>
her so I can complete these last few stamps. Then I am going to take a <br/>
month to do maintenance on all the boxes I have out there. Or get <br/>
drunk. I haven't decided yet. :) <br/>
<br/>
So look for more boxes to come in the next week or so. If you don't <br/>
hear from me for a month after that...it's because I'm on sabbatical!<br/>
<br/>
How are y'all handling this rain?!?<br/>

<div>Well, yesterday it didn't rain all day, so I managed to plant a box I couldn't find a spot for a couple of weeks ago. Two words: sticky velcro. I just wish the subway didn't sometimes turn what should have been a nice day into kind of a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng drag. But I got the box done!! </div>

<div>missmoon........who's goal is 100 boxes before I die.   LOLOL! </div>

<div> </div>
<div>    Girl Scouts finally has a badge for older girls that involves geocaching and LETTERBOXING! My girls are going to be so excited! They will be helping with my letterboxing event this Saturday which will help towards those requirements.</div>
<div>    My questions are: what do you use to clean your stamps? I have been using baby wipes but I was wondering if anyone else has a different method.  </div>
<div>    Also, can someone explain "mystery boxes", "hitchhikers", "cuckoo clues", Easter eggs", "personal traverls" and "virtual letterboxes"?? Thanks so much!</div>

I believe you can find answers to all of the above questions on the <br/>
very useful site, www.atlasquest.com<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't checked it out yet, you should take a look, and join <br/>
(small fee, but worth it, and there's a free version, too)<br/>
Atlasquest not only has tutorials, FAQs, and message boards, but <br/>
probably the most useful part is that you can keep an online log of <br/>
all your finds and plants -- and it notifies you when someone finds <br/>
your box.<br/>
<br/>
Also special searches for areas, and for trips, so you can letterbox <br/>
along the way. You can also host clues for your letterboxes on this <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
It connects to letterboxing.org, but adds on many functions and info <br/>
that is on the LbNA site. Plus, longtime letterboxer and atlasquest <br/>
web site developer, Ryan, makes continual improvements. It just <br/>
keeps getting better.<br/>

stamps with the sticky sheet foam you can buy at<br/>
Michaels, they are simple designs, inexpensive and<br/>

I appreciate the offer...and I might take you up on it once I get my <br/>
100 plants done. But I want this first 100 boxes to all be ones I <br/>
planted myself.  All traditional too. (no HH's, personal travelers, <br/>
etc) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But once I reach that milestone, I would love to have a box planted in <br/>
your area...especially one I can visit during next years Docks, Box, <br/>
Locks or whatever you call it! lol   Send me your snail mail address <br/>
and I'll send one up your way. If you like, I can return the favor and <br/>
plant one for you in NY.<br/>

<br/>
I think Norasta is saying that she has found a medium that is fast, <br/>
easy and inexpensive..and still leaves a nice image.  I know many <br/>
stamp making classes use foam for beginners because it is so easy to <br/>
work with. <br/>
<br/>
As for BACKING stamps in foam...I love it! Some of my stamps are a <br/>
little bigger and therefore unstable and the foam backing really <br/>
helps leave a nice, complete image. Some of the stamps I find are <br/>
very tiny...and the foam backing the carver has used makes them MUCH <br/>
easier to use!  I find I stay CLEANER stamping in with foam-backed <br/>
stamps as well. My finger tips stay further away from the ink.  I <br/>
only recently started backing MY stamps with foam and it was really <br/>
easy and much appreciated by others.<br/>

<br/>
I hear you. The industrial strength velcro is a MUST when you are urban <br/>
boxing. That's what I used for my "Loud House" box hidden in the <br/>
Carrier Dome.<br/>

<div> Hi!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    Girl Scouts finally has a badge for older girls that involves geocaching and LETTERBOXING! My girls are going to be so excited! They will be helping with my letterboxing event this Saturday which will help towards those requirements.</div>
<div>    My questions are: what do you use to clean your stamps? I have been using baby wipes but I was wondering if anyone else has a different method.  </div>
<div>    Also, can someone explain "mystery boxes", "hitchhikers", "cuckoo clues", Easter eggs", "personal traverls" and "virtual letterboxes"?? Thanks so much!</div>

<div>I did mean backing with foam. I guess I didn't read her note well enough. I just zeroed in on the word foam and thought backing. Maybe I'll try it one of these days. </div>
