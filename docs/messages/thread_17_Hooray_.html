                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1649986804">You're most welcome! I'm very glad to see Central NY come so alive with <br/>
letterboxing! I do have heartfelt connections having grown up in Utica, and <br/>
going to college in Brockport before moving to Boston. It seems funny to be <br/>
moderating and promoting this group from almost 3,000 miles away, though. <br/>
But I have my own somewhat selfish agenda, and here it is:<br/>
<br/>
1. I have niece and great-nephews that I'm glad to see break away from TV, <br/>
and get outdoors to do something fun and creative. I got them started, and <br/>
they're having fun. Having a bigger letterboxing community in the area, <br/>
makes it more fun and exciting, not just for them, but for the whole area. <br/>
Let's face it: in much of NY, there aren't enough recreational activities <br/>
for young people, and they end up "hanging out", bored, either in their <br/>
neighborhoods, or at the mall. Letterboxing is a great alternative.<br/>
<br/>
2. Every year, I visit my family, and I want to have some fun in Central NY <br/>
myself!<br/>
<br/>
However, if anyone local wants to take over as moderator of this group, I'm <br/>
sure that the Northern California Letterboxers Group (LbNCA) would cheer, as <br/>
I'm running behind in some promised collaborative work, such as boxes <br/>
Vertigo #2 and #3.<br/>
