I think that her Topics of the Week keep this Yahoo group actively <br/>
thinking and participating. It's a great way to allow everyone to <br/>
contribute when and if they want to. She's a great resource for <br/>
ideas and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I've very pleased to see how this group is growing, and most <br/>
importantly, how well everyone shares and works together to bring <br/>
letterboxing to NY. This group seems to be free of competing <br/>
interests and bickering... Hooray! That's a compliment to everyone <br/>
as members, and also to Catbead as our moderator.<br/>
<br/>
SO, folks! Please join me in a BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE and a CHEER <br/>
loud enough to be heard in San Francisco for the great job Catbead <br/>
has done! <br/>
<br/>
[Major applause and wild cheering heard everywhere, please!].<br/>

Happy Catbead Appreciation Week!<br/>

Erie Winter" HH in the MA Tri-State Letterbox Hike Box this past Mon. <br/>
A beautiful stamp!!  It made its way to Maine and down through MA. <br/>
It was great to find b/c we're from the Syracuse area and know the <br/>
Erie Canal. We'll now have to put "Summer on the Erie Canal" on our <br/>
list to find when we go home to visit.   Onwards to its next <br/>
destination........ Kim</div>
