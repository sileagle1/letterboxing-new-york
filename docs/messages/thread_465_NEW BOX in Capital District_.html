The box is in a sheltered area and should be accessible all year long.<br/>

DANCE FLURRY LETTERBOX<br/>

</font><font color="#000000" face="Hei" size="2">During the third week in February 2006<br/>
they</font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"> will </font><font color="#000000" face="Hei" size="2">be tapping &amp; swinging and doing high kicks.<br/>
Whether you hip-hop, honky-tonk or belly dance,<br/>
swing, salsa, tango or just shake your pants,<br/>
the annual Dance Flurry Festival will chase away the blues -<br/>
just remember to wear your soft-soled shoes.<br/>
<br/>
To find this special event-themed treasure,<br/>
head to Saratoga Springs for business or pleasure.<br/>
Begin at the bronze ballet slippers left behind on a stair.<br/>
In front of Putnam Market you will find the pair.<br/>
From there, head north and find a large clock.<br/>
It is on a corner at a bank just up the block.<br/>
Head in the direction of noon and cross the street,<br/>
and listen to the tip-tap of your dancing feet.<br/>
<br/>
At the Bonacio sign, follow the walk to the fish.<br/>
Warm up your hips with a back-and-forth swish.<br/>
Next door, find the old movie house ticket booth<br/>
where older Saratogians saw shows in their youth.<br/>
With your back to the booth, look for a horse.<br/>
If dancing is your thing, this place is the source.<br/>
This building is headquarters for this dance fest.<br/>
Now cross the street to the horses and take a rest.<br/>
<br/>
Choose the middle set of steps and look around<br/>
When the coast is clear, look for a gap near the ground.<br/>
It is straight ahead in the middle of the horses three<br/>
A huge, round, white planter with a space below snug and tiny.<br/>
Look in there and then do a little jig,<br/>
because the hand-carved stamp is really something to dig!</font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font></html></font></html></div>
