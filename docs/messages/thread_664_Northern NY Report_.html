<br/>
Was finally able to take a "boxing " day and do some serious boxing <br/>
in NY. Original plan was to make another trip to Oswego, but <br/>
becvause of the uncertain status of a bunch of the boxes, esp at <br/>
Rice Creek Field Station...I decided to travel through Watertown, <br/>
Lowville, Boonville, Parish, Central Square and Brewerton, then <br/>
tryiong for a box or two in Oswego. Here's the lowdown...<br/>
<br/>
I picked up 16 of a possible 19 boxes, plus a HH<br/>
<br/>
Here's the rundown...<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Islands Park...gone. Found the spot ok.. but looks to be a <br/>
teen/fisherman hangout area, judging by the broken beer bottles and <br/>
butts.<br/>
<br/>
Orpaned Elephant (Watertown)- great spot, lots of visitors, esp <br/>
younger ones!<br/>
<br/>
Was going to try for for Rushing Water near Lowville, but <br/>
unfortunately, the clue doesnt say where to pick up the road.<br/>
<br/>
Fountain (all Boonville)<br/>
Liberty and Justice<br/>
Over The Canal<br/>
Remember..          All great carvings in very kid accessible areas<br/>
<br/>
Family Tree (3) Nice series, nice spot, well-carved. Like these <br/>
kinds of boxes that have real meaning to someone.<br/>
<br/>
Salmon (Orwell)  very pretty spot, and great waterfall!<br/>
<br/>
Trick or Treat (3) (Parish) another neat cemetery - had to practice <br/>
my stealth as the groundskeeper was trying to cut the grass! Handy <br/>
camera to the rescue as I did my best taphophile imitation!<br/>
<br/>
Bird of a Different Color #4 - (Toad Harbor) found this little guy <br/>
safe and sound.. and enjoying the company of the Slitherin Snake HH! <br/>
Now have 4 of the 7 in this series.<br/>
<br/>
Flaky boxes (Brewerton) picked up 3 more that we missed in Feb...<br/>
<br/>
Bentley Snowflake<br/>
A Simple Snowflake<br/>
An Alaskan Snowflake all well worth the stop!<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to pick up the other 6 we missed, but couldnt figure out <br/>
where the Yellow trail was...!<br/>
<br/>
Tried to find<br/>
Steve Irwin.. vegetation made it pretty difficult to see the forest <br/>
floor, so had to leave him  Crikey!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, off to Oswego..<br/>
<br/>
tried for Ladybug's Fuzzy Caterpiller - great walk, but alas, it <br/>
appears he has metamorphed and flown away!<br/>
<br/>
Daylight became my enemy at this point, so had to leave the other 25 <br/>
or so Oswego boxes for another trip!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you wonderful planters!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1616003783">Thanks for the great report, Jiggs!Â  I am heading out for a long Adirondack weekend.....6 days of bliss and hiking. I will be stopping in the Herkimer area on the way down to hopefully snag all those Herkimer area boxes that have been popping up thanks to CathCainGwen and Rebel Boxer. Then on to the potholes on Powley Piseco road. I am sad to say the last remnents of the "castle" on Castle Road have been torn down. I am glad I got to bring some boxers to see it before it was gone. The property is now private and a home is being built there overlooking those incredible waterfalls..so someone is very lucky indeed.<br/><br/>If anyone has my cell number and wants to meet up in the Southern Adirondacks this weekend...give me a call! woo hooooooo!<br/><br/>LW Phd<br/>"Nice Counts"<br/><br/><b><i>jiggs11onlb &lt;jiggs111@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1616003783replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1616003783ygrp-text"> <div>Hello all!<br/> <br/> Was finally able to take a "boxing " day and do some serious boxing <br/> in NY.
