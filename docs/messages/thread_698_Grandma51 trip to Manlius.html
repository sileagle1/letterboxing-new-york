I will be visiting there this Sunday and my stay depends on how many <br/>
boxes I plan on looking for.  I already spoke to Catbead and we are <br/>
going to do an exchange and some boxing one afternoon.  I plan on <br/>
going to Dewitt, Fayetteville, Fabius, Pompey, Oneida, Liverpool, <br/>
Jamesville, Canastota and maybe Homer.  I'm not sure I will get to <br/>
them all, but that's the plan.  If someone knows of a place near <br/>
Manlius where we can get some exchanges and maybe get a cup of coffee <br/>
or some lunch or whatever, I would be interested.  I would love <br/>
meeting the people who's boxes I have already found there and hope to <br/>
find.  I know Loch wench has already moved and I'm sorry I won't get a <br/>
chance to meet with her.  I could even meet in the evening if that's <br/>
more convenient.  Am looking forward to the adventure and some fun.  I <br/>
just started carving a few weeks ago, but hope to get some carved to <br/>
bring along to plant.  I have 3 already done and ready to go.  If <br/>
anyone is interested, please let me know.  Thanks<br/>
