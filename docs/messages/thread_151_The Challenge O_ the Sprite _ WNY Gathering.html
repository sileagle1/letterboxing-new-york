Got a new box in Buffalo's Theater District sent to us from Lightnin Bug!<br/>
BTW, we're thinking of holding the next WNY Gathering near Rochester, close<br/>
to the lake. Anyone have any problems with that?<br/>

&gt; Subject: The Challenge o' the Sprite<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While enjoying a warm brewed beverage late one night in an idyllic small<br/>
&gt; town far - but not too far - from her usual domain, a certain Sprite<br/>
&gt; wondered aloud to a certain resident of said idyllic (gorge-ous, even)<br/>
&gt; small town how long a specific sort of foreign object secreted inside any<br/>
&gt; one of the multiple locations of a certain well-known regional purveyor of<br/>
&gt; foodstuffs and sundries might successfully avoid detection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The local resident took the Sprite's query as a challenge to all who<br/>
&gt; frequent said establishment and has set in place the first three entries<br/>
</span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what should become a disheartening (at least to those of the janitorial<br/>
&gt; persuasion) plethora of attempts to claim the honor of surviving intact<br/>
</span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lengthiest period of time before being lost, retrieved, or (gasp!)<br/>
&gt; confiscated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The rules are simple. Identify the establishment. It is said that Fortune<br/>
&gt; smiles upon it, at least this particular year. If you are one of the lucky<br/>
&gt; ones with access to this haven of practically anything that might be<br/>
&gt; desired by ravenous mortals, create your own response to the Sprite's<br/>
&gt; challenge by the Ides of May. Be discreet in what you choose to leave<br/>
&gt; behind, and where. Wait, and then wait some more. To the victor comes<br/>
</span></blockquote>great<br/>
