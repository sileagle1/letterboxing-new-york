be willing to travel a little farther west in search of good<br/>
letterboxes.<br/>

We've been getting more into urban letterboxes, as neither of us is a<br/>
proficient enough hiker to do some of the more difficult trails (i<br/>
have really bad knees and asthma, so i find anything more than a<br/>
moderate hike very difficult).<br/>
<br/>
We're planning a few boxes and possibly some microboxes in the Capital<br/>
Region.  I'll post to this list when they're up.  In the meantime, i'd<br/>
be pleased to make the online acquaintance of anyone from our area!<br/>

Namesake series, The Place of the Nettles, and Trip-Trap, Trip-Trap are all <br/>

Drillmaster would be accessible, but it's been reported missing recently. If <br/>
we manage to replace it, add it to the list and come and get it!<br/>
