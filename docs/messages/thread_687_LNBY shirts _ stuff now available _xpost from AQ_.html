that made the original LBNY shirt with the hiker design, so I decided<br/>
to try my hand at fooling around with Cafe Press and the LBNY logo<br/>
alone. Man, you can make TONS of cool stuff on there...it was like<br/>
shopping without actually shopping! Just go to this link and choose<br/>
your t-shirt (or hoodie, or mug or hat...went a little crazy here!),<br/>
then they send it to you! The Highlander and I are totally out of the<br/>
loop, so no waiting for shirts or entrusting us with your money<br/>
anymore. The down side would be there's no hiker logo anymore (since<br/>
that was the property of the company from before), but the up side is<br/>
our logo is right on the front where it can be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you can check it out and go from there! Here's the link:<br/>

I'm going to get a baseball shirt for him right now! :-)<br/>
