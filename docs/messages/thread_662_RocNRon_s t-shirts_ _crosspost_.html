Sweet &amp; RocNRon that we (the Highlander &amp; I) just can't seem to<br/>
locate. He had planned to pick them up, so we didn't originally send<br/>
them out to him, but I'm not sure if we later decided to mail them off<br/>
or handed them off to other boxers to pass on to him. Does anyone have<br/>
any idea as  to the whereabouts of said shirts? Let us know...we<br/>
really want to make sure he gets these!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
