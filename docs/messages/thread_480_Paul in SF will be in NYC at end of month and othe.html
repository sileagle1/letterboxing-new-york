It's been a while since I've posted here, hasn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I was in Utica this past weekend for the funeral of my extended <br/>
family "Mom", a truly wonderful, loving woman. Almost 1,000 people <br/>
showed up at the wake, which speaks volumes for how she touched many <br/>
lives (including mine).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was VERY amused that it was warm and snow-free in central <br/>
NY, while at the same time, San Francisco was cold enough to have a <br/>
dusting of something resembling white stuff, but more like ice <br/>
crystals. Repeat after me and our leader, Dubya, "There is no such <br/>
thing as global warming...".<br/>
<br/>
While in Utica, I did scout out a potential box planting site for <br/>
when I return in July. I plan on spending about 10 days in Utica-<br/>
Rome in July, and I think we'll throw together a gathering/LbNY 2nd <br/>
anniversary celebration. <br/>
<br/>
I'll also run another 'Creative Thinking for Letterboxers' workshop, <br/>
like I did here in SF. It was a big success, lots of fun, too, and <br/>
we generated hundred of ideas for new &amp; creative letterboxes. (Well, <br/>
some of them, Lock Wench had already beat us to, but anyway...)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, this month, I have a resceduled one week vacation in the Big <br/>
Apple. I was originally supposed to go last fall. This time, it's <br/>
for real.<br/>
<br/>
SO, I'm going to prepare a box or maybe two to plant in Manhattan, <br/>
AND if Miss Moon is available, we can do out meet &amp; exchange <br/>
finally. (Miss Moon, are you there? What about getting together?)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else in the area would like to connect up with the <br/>
infamous LbNY founder and bicoastal letterboxer, let me know, OK? <br/>
<br/>
I'm in Manhattan for the full last week of March. I'll replant my <br/>
niece's MIA box, too.)<br/>
<br/>
For those with curious minds, you can see what I've been up to by <br/>
checking out my blog, "Paul Is In SF, Yes!" at <br/>
<a href="http://pgonyea.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pgonyea.blogspot.com</a>  where you'll see some of my digital art <br/>
projects, hear me rant about our government a bit, and also find <br/>
some very useful fun things.<br/>
<br/>
LB'ing hugs all around,<br/>

<div>Hey there Paul in SF........that sounds like a good idea. The only day I know for sure I won't be around is the 25th. Weather permitting I'll be boxing in Pa with some other intrepid Women of Mid-Atlantic Boxing. And I work 2-10pm M-F., so am available in the mornings. We shouldn't have a problem getting together. Stay in touch. Maybe we could have an impromptu mini urban gathering if anyone wants to join us. That would be cool. <a href="mailto:nfmoon@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nfmoon@...</a></div>

So sorry to hear about your "Mom." Sounds like she touched a lot of <br/>
people, considering that turnout. <br/>
<br/>
Not sure when you are planning to be in Utica during July...but I <br/>
should be around except for a short vacation at Racquette Lake. I <br/>
have some boxes for the Rome area too.. one based on the lost village <br/>
of Delta and another Taphophile box, so maybe we can do some planting <br/>
together. I think a get together would be great. There are a bunch of <br/>
LBNY's who would love to meet you. I'm psyched to attend a Creative <br/>
Letterboxing workshop too. Sounds like you had so many great ideas <br/>
for that one.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Hedwig and the Angry Inch box I want planted in Manhattan. <br/>
Miss Moon offered to find her way to MoPo to plant it for <br/>
me...otherwise the Park would be fine. I'll send it down there so <br/>
maybe the two of you can have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think it was really great of you to visit Robb in the hospital <br/>
and keep LisaScenic's spirits up. I know she really appreciates it. <br/>
Miss you muchly - <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-683421216">Any clue as to when you might be up at Racquette Lake? Darlene &amp; Deidre want<br/>
me to decide when in July I'll be there, so Darlene can take some vacation<br/>
time. Of course, if we do a little gathering, then I sure want you around!<br/>
Have you heard from MtNestRobin at all? Trenton might be a good location for<br/>
this year's gathering.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Darlene &amp; I scoped out Frankfort Gorge as a potential planting<br/>
spot for boxes. I told her about the balloon farm, not realizing you have a<br/>
box there. I didn't have my letterboxing stuff with me, or else I would've<br/>
looked for the Curling Club.<br/>
<br/>
This year, I'll probably try to plant at Sylvan Beach.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun &amp; easy seeing Robb at the hospital -- it's only 1 block away from<br/>
my apt. Now that he's home, I don't have that "neighbor" to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Are you still coming to SF? When?<br/>
