<br/>
What do you do with your boxes in winter?  Bring them home or leave <br/>
them in place thru the harsh winter months known to CNY?  Does it <br/>
depend on where you have them located?   Drive-bys stay and hard to <br/>
reach during winter trails bring them home?<br/>
<br/>
What does the freezing cold temps do to your lovingly made stamps?  <br/>
Hurt them?  <br/>
<br/>
We just placed our first three boxes and now we are struggling with <br/>
what to do for the winter months.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you replies.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I joined the group last night, although I"m not 
quite sure I actually belong to Central NY... I'm in Beacon, just south of 
Poughkeepsie, NY.  A woman without a grup I suppose...</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">No can tell with the winters we've been having... 
you might get cold... you might get snow... you might get nothing but rain.... 
Since that Space shuttle exploded up in the stratusphere, our weather has just 
NOT been right... (sorry the conspiracy theorist in me, rears it's ugly head 
every now and again, LOL)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We have a box up Mt. Beacon... 1500 feet... and 
very cold..... The Speedball "like buttah" stuff has not held up 
well   We also have boxes in not so extreme places... The Speedball 
stuff has not held up well... almost every one out there will have to be pulled 
and mounted, since they all broke into two pieces.  </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The PZKut has has held up very well.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We ultamately stopped putting ink pads in... we 
only used the cheapie A.C.Moore $.99 pads and they have either gunked up or 
dried out.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Our boxes stay out year round....  We've got 
12 of 34 planted and I'm in the process of  carving another 50 stamp series 
that will be planted in one state park (still looking for one big enough) 
LOL  That's just too many boxes to consider pulling.</font></div>

<br/>
Last winter I wanted to see how the centrifuge tubes and ink pads<br/>
fared.  Both did just fine.  Although one regular sized box had a lot<br/>
of water in it when we checked in the spring.  The lid was on right,<br/>
so the problem was a leaky container....but everything was ok inside<br/>
because of the double bagging.<br/>
<br/>
Over the holidays visitors come by, so as long as the box isn't frozen<br/>
solid into the ground, why not box thru the winter?      <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

It just wouldn't survive the winter, so "Jolly Roger" will sail away <br/>
from November til Easter.  The rest we're planning to leave in place, <br/>
although I know the odds really aren't in our favor for a few of <br/>
them.  We're keeping our fingers crossed!</div>
