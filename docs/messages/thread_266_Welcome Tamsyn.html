getting down to the Capital area soon.<br/>
<br/>
Our group is friendly and easy going...and includes some of the most <br/>
generous people I have ever met. Glad to have you join us!<br/>
<br/>
Fall is quickly filling up with gatherings..and I am committed to <br/>
attending the LBWNY event, and possibly the Mark and Sue Pepe Oct 1st <br/>
one as I have been asked to carve a stamp for that event. But I am <br/>
still mulling over an idea to have a mini gathering down at Moss Island <br/>
for the CNY boxers. I will be sure to keep in touch and will post here <br/>
about it.<br/>
