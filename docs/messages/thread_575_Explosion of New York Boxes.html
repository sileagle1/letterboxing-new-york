                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-31819160">This week included an explosion of recently planted New York State<br/>
boxes. From Buffalo to Albany, from Long Island to Potsdam, and every<br/>
point in between; new boxers are dipping their toes in the water and<br/>
trying to plant a special box for others to enjoy. And plenty of<br/>
experienced boxers have planted one last box before the end of summer!<br/>
<br/>
Please be kind and mindful of all the newbies in this hobby. Many have<br/>
read the recent Family Fun article and decided to try this hobby. Some<br/>
have been introduced to the hobby by family and friends. Some are<br/>
doing a great deal of research first by reading everything they can on<br/>
letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com and personal websites while others<br/>
are jumping in with very little research at all. <br/>
<br/>
I personally believe it doesn't take that much time to write a<br/>
response to a placer and let them know about your experience. If you<br/>
like the walk, the visit, the box, the stamp, the clues.....let them<br/>
know! If you  have issues with a box, still congratulate them on their<br/>
effort and give them KIND and GENTLE suggestions on what could make<br/>
their boxes even better. I personally am forever indebted to those<br/>
more experienced boxers who took the time to write to me, meet me at<br/>
events,  talk to me online, and basically encourage and gently<br/>
instruct me on how I could improve my carving/clue writing/planting<br/>
skills. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing includes a learning curve and we were all newbies once.<br/>
Even some of the most experienced American letterboxers have told me<br/>
that they are indebted to those Dartmoor boxers who began this<br/>
wonderful hobby. And these same boxers have told me that they are<br/>
continually amazed by the creativity, artistic skills, or open and<br/>
welcoming spirit of so many new boxers. They also confess that they<br/>
have learned new procedures, been introduced to cool locations, have<br/>
learned of new supply sources and even some new hiding techniques from<br/>
newbies. It's never too late to teach an old dog some new tricks! So<br/>
be kind, help educate and support newbies in your area and share some<br/>
letterboxing love.<br/>

<br/>
And as for a learning curve, I don't think that should include common sense<br/>
things like RE-HIDING of boxes and treatment of the contents of said box. I<br/>
have more than one box go missing after some new boxer tells me exicitedly<br/>
how it was their first box.......oh yea!!....what a great hobby, we're so<br/>
excited about it, blah, blah, blah. The next thing I know it comes up gone.<br/>
My patience is running a little thin...ok....*has* run thin. I'm starting<br/>
to dread new boxers going near mine. I'm beginning to understand that AQ<br/>
thing of having to have "x" numbers of finds before being able to look at<br/>
the clues. <br/>
<br/>
It took me about 5 seconds to figure out  HELLO..........the box has to be<br/>
hidden so it can't be seen and don't let anyone see me retrieving and<br/>
re-hiding. If someone has to learn something like<br/>
that....well...........puh-lease. <br/>

</span></blockquote>Yeah, I'm cranky about that too.  :-)  When I started<br/>
boxing in Feb (yes I'm new too!) I probably read LBNA<br/>
and AQ in their entirety plus googled a few other<br/>
sites as well.  Then I found probably 10 boxes before<br/>
I planted my first one.  And my first one still<br/>
sucked.  ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
My own personal pet peeve though is when people use<br/>
frickin' archival ink on stamps and wreck the chances<br/>
for anyone after them to use a different colour...<br/>
there was this one Winnie the Pooh series and we<br/>
destroyed our ink pad because of the black horrible<br/>
ink someone had left on it... UGH!  (That same series<br/>
had two boxes left in plain sight as well...)<br/>
<br/>
I have definitely put F restrictions on a couple of my<br/>
boxes, for just that reason.  I know someone always<br/>
jumps in with "well sometimes oldies don't rehide<br/>
boxes well" but I'm willing to be that's the rare<br/>
exception, not the rule, and it's my exp in following<br/>
new boxers to a box that more often, they are not<br/>
rehiding well. <br/>

mistakes. lol<br/>
<br/>
But seriously...this is a good conversation to have as there are TONS<br/>
of new people coming into the hobby and they can use all the help they<br/>
can get. I also took the time to read everything I could and yet there<br/>
isstill no substitute for going out with an experienced boxer. I<br/>
still remember jumping up and down "whooping" in the woods when I<br/>
found my first box....one of Catbead's. It was like this weird<br/>
confirmation..."wow...it works! You follow the clues exactly and you<br/>
will actually find a box!" lol I am sure if she was with me, she would<br/>
have arched an eyebrow and whacked me with her fanny pack.<br/>
<br/>
But when I finally had the honor of meeting her and going boxing with<br/>
her....I learned SO MUCH! The best part was watching her hide/rehide a<br/>
box. This woman is THOROUGH. Not just hidden, but hidden behind a log<br/>
or something that will still hide the box from view from the trail if<br/>
an animal pulls it out or if a newbie/silverback is in too much of a<br/>
hurry to hide properly. And not just covered with some forest litter<br/>
but - covered with some forest litter, then a rock to anchor it,( or<br/>
under the lip of a ledge or something) and MORE sprinkles of forest<br/>
litter to disguise the newly placed rock. And not just looking to see<br/>
if you can see anything poking out from the trail, but walking around<br/>
it and checking it from all angles. Are you listening, newbies, <br/>
parents, scout leaders and class teachers?? :) Let's educate boxers<br/>
from the get-go!<br/>
<br/>
When I first started planting, I planted boxes that were available for<br/>
everyone as Iwanted to encourage families to do this together. I admit<br/>
I gotcarried away (I love to carve, and carved like crazy but then<br/>
realizedI would have to plant them all! eek!) but I later started<br/>
putting restrictions on some of my boxes. I got a lot of complaints<br/>
about it but I don't feel guilty in the least because well over half<br/>
of my boxes are open to all. Restrictions I used for more sensitive<br/>
areas that required more stealth, or couldn't stand up to a lot of<br/>
foot traffic, or just because I wanted to reward people who stuck with<br/>
the hobby for more than a week or two.<br/>
<br/>
But I admit I broke the cardinal rule. I planted my first boxes (a<br/>
series of 3)  before I had found many boxes. So I made ALL the typical<br/>
mistakes...notebooks with lined paper, ink in the boxes (they are<br/>
liable to freeze or leak in my area and did so before I pulled them<br/>
back out), cheaper baggies that didn't close easily so the logbooks<br/>
got soaked) and easily compromised hiding spots ( like too close to<br/>
kid's playground..where kids would explore every area nearby). I lost<br/>
every one of the boxes at some point so I learned to save copies of my<br/>
stamps so I could recarve, to use better materials in my boxes, and to<br/>
use better camoflage and hiding techniques. But as for that first<br/>
series? It's still out there....I'm too sentimental to retire it and<br/>
it's close enough to my house that I can check on it regularly. I DID<br/>
upgrade the materials, though. :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Thanks for the warning about using archival ink. I suspect that when<br/>
people want to try this hobby they first use what they have at home<br/>
before purchasing new stuff which is perfectly understandable.   I<br/>
know a lot of scrapbookers (and others) use this archival ink and<br/>
might decide to start with that.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried wiping it off gently when I find this gunk on a stamp, but<br/>
you are right..it doesn't always come off. <br/>
<br/>
So remember, folks....dont use the archival ink! Try a dye based ink (<br/>
dries fast but also runs if the logbook gets wet) or a pigment ink<br/>
(dries slower but stays put if the logbook gets wet). When using<br/>
pigment ink, blot with a slip of paper after stamping in to take up<br/>
some of the excess. And in your own logbook, carry a slip of paper<br/>
between the pages to help blot so you don't ruin your newly acquired<br/>
stamp image. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-648849884">Yeah, I agree Miss Moon. Yesterday afternoon was so beautiful that after work I took the pups to check on my Historic Auburn boxes.  We did not get far (the mosquitos on the trail were HORRIBLE and "someone" forgot the bug spray...whoops) but we made it to the first box, which is hidden in the deep nook of a tree.  I came upon it totally uncovered, with only a piece of bark sitting on top (totally exposing all the sides). :o(  Upon opening the box and examining the logbook, I saw that the most recent stamped entries were all boxers I have never seen stamped before, or only stamped in a couple logbooks. Newbies. I was furious. It's COMMON SENSE to rehide a box that is hidden--it's what letterboxing is all about. Hidden boxes. You REHIDE them when done.  If you don't care to follow the rules, don't play the game. And unfortunately this is not the first time.  Mid-summer, checking on some other boxes of mine (most notably Auburn Doubledays), I also found mostly exposed and uncovered, just tossed into it's hiding place. Last person stamped in the boxes was a semi-newbie (I know  boxing under a year). I couldn't believe it. It is highly disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
To that end, I have decided I will be pulling my CCC Nature trail boxes permenantly (this is the 9 box "Lucy and Clifford Wildlife Adventures" series).

I am very sorry that this is happening.  There are concious boxers out there who take the hobby seriously and are responsible boxers.

<br/>
I'll probably be pulling the CCC boxes next month (late October most likely) so if you want them, nows your time to stamp them. Depending on my pre-winter checks of my other 20 or so boxes, I will be permanently pulling those as well (if I do, I'll post an email and amend LB.org/Atlasquest so people don't make the trip for nothing!).<br/>

boxes before they're gone! <br/>
<br/>
I've been experiencing a similar situation with my boxes. I've had <br/>
everything from the lock-n-lock lids being snapped on upside down <br/>
(seriously, how does that even happen?!), to the lid not even on the <br/>
container but all the contents neatly piled inside, to "hey, is that <br/>
a tupperware container I see half a mile down the trail" kind of <br/>
problems. And each time I come across something like this, the last <br/>
stamp in the logbook is someone new. In my case, it's been the same <br/>
few groups of boxers that don't use AQ and don't post to LBNA. I <br/>
have no way of contacting them at all. I'm getting tired of going to <br/>
St. Paul's and finding the Celtic Cross lb completely uncovered. I'm <br/>
thinking of retiring those 2 boxes this winter. I love the location <br/>
and the interesting things to see, but folks just aren't taking the <br/>
time to re-hide those ones. I know it can be difficult to be sneaky <br/>
in a place like St. Paul's, but that's part of the challenge! <br/>
Dandelion and I were at the WNY gathering last year and afterwards <br/>
we decided to hit a couple more local boxes. We did the one at the <br/>
Erie canal and ended up being trapped by noxers. They didn't know <br/>
what we were doing, but we were unable to re-hide the box while they <br/>
were there. We fiddled around, we took a stroll, we admired the <br/>
view, we took an interest in wildflowers. We killed time until the <br/>
noxers left. We were there for an hour. But we re-hid the box just <br/>
as we found it, leaving no sign that it was there.<br/>
<br/>
It was our responsibility to do that. If something had happened to <br/>
that box, it would have been my fault. I didn't like that thought, <br/>
so we took responsibilty for the box and did what was right. <br/>
<br/>
I hope others will show my boxes the same courtesy.<br/>

<br/>
First I'd like to say that when we first started researching this <br/>
hobby and got started a few years ago I do not ever remember reading <br/>
anything about NOT using archival ink. As a scrapbooker this was the <br/>
first type of ink I would have gone after not knowing it would cause <br/>
issues with the stamp. So if I happened to harm anyones stamp in the <br/>
process I appologize. I just went now and checked the ink we use and <br/>
it says dye ink archival quality. Is that safe to use?? If NOT <br/>
please let me know and we will be out today looking for a different <br/>
ink. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly I can't speak for anyone else but if we ever find a box and <br/>
you learn later that it has gone missing after us please feel free <br/>
to contact us as soon as you find out. I'd be happy to provide you <br/>
with the information I can remember on where we found it, how we <br/>
rehid it, etc. As I said I'm a scrapbooker and take alot of pictures.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think most people would be upset if you come across a box <br/>
that was left exposed and you emailed them. I again wouldn't be and <br/>
would actually be fine although embarrassed if someone contacted me <br/>
to let me know that my rehiding skills were not up to par. Plus it's <br/>
not to say that it wasn't dragged out by a creature or found by <br/>
someone else later. It would just be information to let them know <br/>
that maybe they need to put a little more effort into rehiding the <br/>
box. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

I'm not naming any names on this board.  I don't want to be so rude <br/>
as to accuse without proof.  They are the last person who logged the <br/>
find on AQ (I talked to the planter) and the last in the book, but <br/>
that doesn't mean that someone else didn't look for them to try out <br/>
the hobby.  It seems unlikely that someone new would find 15 boxes <br/>
and not write in any of the logbooks, though.  Is it more likely that <br/>
someone with years of experience left every box in the series <br/>
exposed?  I don't know.  How would you even email that person?  It's <br/>
not like they don't know any better.  Mostly I'm just glad the boxes <br/>
were all still there for us to rehide properly a week and a half <br/>
later.  If those had been urban boxes they would be gone, every <br/>
single one!<br/>

How do you score on rehiding the box?<br/>
Are you a ten?  Or do you race from box to box?  <br/>
<br/>
1.	Scope the area for mugglers before rehiding. <br/>
Assign a scout.<br/>
2.	Deflate, squeeze, seal each and every ziplock with<br/>
the zeal of an obsessive compulsive, anally retentive<br/>
ferret.<br/>
3.	Perform a complete contents check to ensure nothing<br/>
has been left out of box.<br/>
4.	Screw, snap, burp  the box tightly and<br/>
appropriately.  Shake &amp; check.<br/>
5.	Rehouse box in exact location as found.  Kneel if<br/>
necessary.<br/>
6.	Replace ALL rocks, leaf litter, branches in an<br/>
artful but casual manner.<br/>
7.	Do a complete 360 sway to make sure the box is not<br/>
visible from any horizontal angle.<br/>
8.	Execute 5 or more stork stretches, peckn bend to<br/>
ensure that the box is not visible from any vertical<br/>
angle.<br/>
9.	Rehide the box yourself! Your child, aged<br/>
grandmother or newbie friend should NOT do this.<br/>
10.	Perform final site and perimeter check.  Move on<br/>
slowly.  Speed kills boxes.<br/>

especially larges ones with lots of boxes where they seem to go into hyper<br/>
speed box mode. And I guess they think another boxer will be along in a few<br/>
minutes. <br/>
<br/>
And the whole thing about education is how much education should a normally<br/>
intelligent adult need to figure out to REHIDE a box? And to leave the<br/>
contents  of the box the way it should be, put the bags back the same way<br/>
with the same things in them. If you need to be taught some of this stuff,<br/>
you shouldn't be boxing. I can understand not knowing terms, how events<br/>
work, what to do with a HH at first, stuff like that.<br/>

uncovered ones I found and heard about this summer) were ALL last stamped<br/>
in by new boxers. But yes, like you, I noticed a few boxes at Desperately<br/>
Seeking Sun that had been found my experienced boxers ahead of me but left<br/>
pretty badly exposed --or TOTALLY exposed--for the next boxer to find.  <br/>

than myself and I am forever grateful to those who took the time to teach<br/>
me letterboxing etiquette. Granted, I had done a lot of research on my own<br/>
but nothing beats boxing with a person more experienced than yourself. I<br/>
hope you will consider posting on the Newboxers website and re-stress the<br/>
importance of rehiding well. The moderators announced that almost 60 new<br/>
people have joined newboxers since the the Family Fun article was<br/>
published. Now is the chance to make yourself heard. You won't cure very<br/>
"quick and easy rehider" but you will do the many "eager to learn the right<br/>
way" consciencious newbies a great service.<br/>

If you don't and just a tiny bit of ziplock is in the Lock n Lock edge groove, the box seal is compromised. I also have not shaken the box to make sure the lid stays put. So 1/2 pt off for that. And I take off a full point for getting lazy about full perimeter looks lately.  I sometimes gauge the angle and decide it can't be seen by the other side without taking the time to actually walk around A the entire box EVERY time.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1252822905">I'm a little confused on this one. Is this talk of ink about <br/>
deciding which kind is more stamp friendly? One that's neater? One <br/>
that's waterproof? I've got ink of all kinds. One could even say <br/>
that I'm an ink junkie! Mostly I use the pigment pads, like the <br/>
ColorWheel dealies. Pigment is good because it stamps really well, <br/>
you can blend colors if you want to, the Petal Points have fine <br/>
corners for inking up those small stamp areas, and -I believe- it <br/>
holds up to the water test.<br/>
<br/>
I also learned a really neat trick at a stamping convention. If <br/>
you're inking up a stamp with more that one pigment inkpad and you <br/>
accidentally get some of a darker color onto the pad of a lighter <br/>
color, you can just lightly wipe it off with a paper towel. Just <br/>
brush the paper towel across the top and it comes right off. Voila!<br/>
<br/>
I always, always, ALWAYS blot off the letterbox stamp after I'm done <br/>
with it. If you look at my personal logbooks you'll see that the <br/>
back page of each one is my blotter. It looks like one of those <br/>
Magic Eye puzzles! I've also gently washed a couple of letterbox <br/>
stamps while I was out on the trails. Just poured a little of my <br/>
bottled water on it and blotted it with a paper towel. <br/>

<br/>
(I just returned from vacation in box-less Romania &amp; saw this <br/>
post... which I must comment on)<br/>
<br/>
While I was in NY in July, my family &amp; I found several of Lock <br/>
Wenchs' and lisascenics' boxes. Our small letterboxing troop <br/>
consisted of 2 great nephews, ages 7 and 10-ish, two adult nieces <br/>
(and members of this group), and znother pre-adolescent polite and <br/>
considerate family member. <br/>
<br/>
The boys often argue over who gets to retrieve or replace the boxes -<br/>
- so we take turns.<br/>
<br/>
At one location, it was the older nephew's turn to replace the box. <br/>
He went over behind the tree where it was planted, we heard <br/>
a "clunk" of plastic against rock, and he returned much too quickly. <br/>
He had merely thrown it on top of a rock near the tree, instead of <br/>
hiding it under a rock at the base of the tree! We were furious!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, my nephew is a very conscientious and intelligent young <br/>
man. Although we had taught him about the importance of replacing <br/>
and concealing the boxes properly, he was just too anxious to get to <br/>
e next box on our hunt to take his time. <br/>
<br/>
WELL, let me assure you that everything stopped then and there and <br/>
qwe had a firm talk about the time and work it takes to create these <br/>
boxes, and what his inconsideration meant both to future finders as <br/>
well as to the planter of the box (who, as a friend who has been <br/>
very good about going out of her way to get my nephew a fabulous, <br/>
unique "first finder's gift, autographed by a local celebrity). <br/>
<br/>
My nephew felt very small and was apologetic. After all that <br/>
discussion and talk about how he was noy being a good letterboxer, <br/>
we sincerely think he's learned his lesson.<br/>
<br/>
We learned a lesson, too, and now we double-check the replanting of <br/>
the boxes. <br/>
<br/>
SO on behalf of the adult letterboxers in my family, I'd like to <br/>
apologize for any poor replacing of boxes my nephew may have done <br/>
along the way... but we think this was a single instance. I'm sure <br/>
it won't happen again.<br/>

But I DO know that your nephew was taught the ethics of letterboxing as I have seen him box at events and have even had the priviledge of looking for boxes he has planted!  He's a great boxer!<br/><br/>But this proves the point...an otherwise carefully trained kid boxer gets excited and doesn't rehide a box well. You did well to check on it, show him how he erred, and even explained WHY it was important to rehide. I wish every parent would do that. <br/><br/>So now I need a volunteer to follow me and make sure I walk around each box I rehide a FULL 360 degrees instead of the 225 degrees I found myself doing lately. Then you'll need to scold me and remind me why it is important.  lol  My point is, we all make mistakes but we all should strive to do better.

After all that <br/> discussion and talk about how he was noy being a good letterboxer, <br/> we sincerely think he's learned his lesson.<br/> <br/> We learned a lesson, too, and now we double-check the replanting of <br/> the boxes. <br/> <br/> SO on behalf of the adult letterboxers in my family, I'd like to <br/> apologize for any poor replacing of boxes my nephew may have done <br/> along the way... but we think this was a single instance. I'm sure <br/> it won't happen again.<br/> <br/> Paul in

I would add a #0 to the list, and that is "Look at how it is hidden<br/>
before you touch anything".  In my excitement I usually want to grab<br/>
it and open it like it was Christmas morning.  But I try to stop and<br/>
look at how it is hidden before I touch it.  You can't rehide it well<br/>
if you didn't know how it was hidden before.  Were there four rocks on<br/>
it?  Where did that big piece of bark go.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as planters, it is our duty to try to find the best spots that<br/>
will ensure good hiding.  Slapping some sticks on I have had to do<br/>
with some of my plants, but if you can find that great<br/>
hidey-hole...you are far better off in keeping this hidden for a long<br/>
time.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Sorry I've been late back to this thread, and I think<br/>
it was me originally complaining. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My problem was that we did a series of boxes and the<br/>
person before us had used some kind of black ink that<br/>
just STAINED the stamp so much... any amount of<br/>
blotting didn't work and I didn't have Wetwipes to try<br/>
that, although now I hear it's a good thing I didn't<br/>
as that can damage the stamp.  It was just black black<br/>
black ick and all we had with us was a red ink pad. <br/>
So, after we had to stamp all those blaaaack covered<br/>
stamps, our red ink pad (brand new) was destroyed and<br/>
covered in black ink.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe it made a crisp, wonderful, waterproof, last<br/>
forever image for the people before us..... but it<br/>
wrecked the stamp for probably the next half dozen<br/>
users until that ink eventually came off. :-(<br/>
<br/>
What should I carry in my bag to help avoid that<br/>
situation? I'm hearing water and flannel? not sure if<br/>
that would have even worked?  Dunno.<br/>
