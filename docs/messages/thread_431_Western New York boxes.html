to my boyhood home.  I printed off all the clues in the area and was<br/>
surprised to see how many there are now in Monroe County alone.  Alas,<br/>
I may not be able to get them all this trip out!  :-(<br/>
<br/>
But I'm gonna try!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I may actually leave later tonight rather than tomorrow and get a<br/>
little 'boxing in tomorrow AM.  We'll see how the day goes.<br/>
<br/>
Going to try to go after Elba Onions Thruway series again.  I didn't<br/>
have much luck last time through, but a second effort is afoot!<br/>
<br/>
If we can coordinate, I may meet Wink et. al. and pick up some boxes<br/>
in the Oswego area too.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in all of that I've got to spend some time with my family! <br/>
Hmmm ... which is the priority ... family or letterboxes?  Letterboxes<br/>
or family?<br/>
<br/>
We'll find out!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone still wishes to connect at some point, send me an e-mail to<br/>
<a href="mailto:seh-letterbox@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seh-letterbox@...</a>.  I'll be checking it all next week.  Best<br/>
to leave a telephone number for ease of contact.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays all!<br/>
