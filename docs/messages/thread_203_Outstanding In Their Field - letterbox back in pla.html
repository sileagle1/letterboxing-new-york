<p>After a crazy week I needed to letterbox and get recentered! I did some box maintenance on some of my boxes ( Oakwood #3 is definately NOT missing) but still need to move Work Drones. I have decided to keep Schiller Park #2 where it is just because that one was a specific request. It may be easier to get to when the summer is over and the place is not crawling with kids. Or go early on a Sunday morning. :)</p>
<p>Had to go to northern  NJ and decided on the way back to do the  5 box  series along Rt. 191 of country United Methodist Churches. (Search for PA and "UMC"). Found all 5 boxes and picked up 2 HH's as well! Not bad! All the churches were cute and I especially loved the outdoor privies behind them! </p>
<p>Once back on the road, I got off 81 and planted my new Tinker Falls box near Tully. The water is not as dramatic now as in the spring but still makes for a fun hike.  These weekend will be busy but hopefully I can squeeze in some boxing along the way. Thanks for all of your suggestions for boxes along 81 and 17. </p>

<div>Make sure you have the latest clues for Oakwood Box #3. It was moved further in awhile back and I want to make sure you have the most up to date clues.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Tinker Falls box is in Labrador Hollow near Tully. It can be accessed by a longer moderate hike ( 5 miles, 1300ft elevation) on the Spruce Pond off Herlihy Road side..but I made my clues from the shorter Route 91 side. It's more fun to scramble over the rocks and it gives you a better view of the falls. No reason you can't hike down the other side though!  If you are traveling the Thruway, you might want to do my Leprechan series...or the Trenton Falls box once you get north of Utica. I love that drive up  Rt. 28  so many memories....and will be there soon myself!  I am currently carving a stamp series for my favorite Adirondack mountain...Chimney Mountain near Indian Lake. It has water, a mountain, a rock climbing "chimney" and caves with ice....what more could a person want???  *grin*  </div>
<div><br/>Enjoy your trip! Let me know how the dogs handled it.</div>
