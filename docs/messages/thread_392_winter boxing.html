                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1463820029">Thanks for the heads up!  I usually find the Atlas Quest message <br/>
boards overwhelming, but your subject line got me right to the thread <br/>
in question.  That's why I like this board, besides being full of <br/>
people I plan to meet one day, it's of a size I can keep up with.<br/>
<br/>
Your point about tracks in the snow exposing boxes was one of the <br/>
things I was wondering about.  It could be fun filling a whole park <br/>
with misleading tracks to disguise the real ones!<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll be letterboxing this winter (my first) and from what I <br/>
read enough people in the area keep looking that I think I will keep <br/>
planting.  I'm still working on the urban plants, it will be <br/>
interesting to see whether they're easier or harder than more rural <br/>
plants to find in the snow!<br/>
<br/>
Still working on that personal traveller!  I was going to box today, <br/>
but it just got really nasty out in the last hour, lots of wind and <br/>
rain here in downtown Bflo, and I swear the wind actually carried the <br/>
smell of the general mills plant out in the outer harbor all the way <br/>
over here.  I recognized the smell from when I got the times beach <br/>
box a while ago.  A great location, for those of you who haven't <br/>
gotten it yet!<br/>

lisascenic, what's your season like at the end of February; could you <br/>
have a visitor for a few days?  I'd love to visit both former <br/>
roommates named Lisa now living on the West Coast at that time.<br/>

Hooray for winter boxing, I was so worried I'd have to stop planting <br/>
and finding!  My work finally slows down in December, so I have plans <br/>
to box.<br/>

    boxing<br/><br/></font></div><tt>I am happy to see there plenty of crazy 
    winter hardy boxers out there. <br/>The Desperately Seeking Sun event is up 
    and running on atlasquest and <br/>people are signing up! I will be posting 
    more info as we get closer to <br/>the event, so stay tuned.  The new "I 
    Love NY HH Hostel" has been <br/>getting a lot of visitors too, so be sure to 
    stop by and swap your HH's <br/>when you are traveling this Thanksgiving 
    holiday.<br/><br/>In the meantime, imagine my surprise as I was working the 
    polls last <br/>night? (I am an election inspector) I looked up as someone 
    called <br/>out "Lock Wench?" It was none other than SpudHund and DarthTater. 
    So <br/>cool to realize how close these boxers live to me! Our Syracuse Mayor 
    <br/>squeaked by his challenger...barely. No word on his slant of "boxing 
    <br/>issues."<br/><br/>I have set aside my boxing hat and pulled on my film 
    fest hat as I am <br/>knee deep in grant applications, but love to read of 
    others' adventures <br/>boxing in our beautiful NY state. So cough it 
    up...what are you all up <br/>to?<br/><br/>Lock Wench<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></tt></blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
