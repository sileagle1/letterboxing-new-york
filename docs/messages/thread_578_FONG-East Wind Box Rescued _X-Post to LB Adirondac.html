removed from what would have probably been a perilous end. They<br/>
removed the box and it is safe and sound. I'll replace it in a new<br/>
safer spot the next time I am in the North Country. Clues on LbNA have<br/>
been updated to reflect the removal and will also note clue changes as<br/>
soon as the box is rehidden.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who have visited.<br/>
