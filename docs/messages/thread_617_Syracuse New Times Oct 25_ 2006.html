Letterboxing is more than a rubber-stamp hobby by Jon Ross<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia read the last clue and rounded the corner. She was in Upper<br/>
Onondaga Park in Strathmore, looking for the final letterbox in the<br/>
Wonders of Onondaga Park series, the first group of boxes she ever<br/>
planted. But instead of searching for the white plastic Wonder Bread<br/>
container, she spied the open box strewn over the rock steps. Someone<br/>
had found the package and taken the materials--- a homemade stamp and<br/>
a small notebook---leaving nothing but the shell of the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
"Sometimes I'll find a box and it will be chewed up," Cynthia says,<br/>
noting that animals uncover materials they come across, but that's<br/>
rare. "Almost always it's some person."<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia, who doesn't use her full name but is known to the<br/>
letterboxing community as "Lock Wench," picked up the remains of the<br/>
box and headed back to the park entrance. This wasn't the first time<br/>
this had happened. "When you put a lot of work into a carving, it's<br/>
devastating when you find it trashed," she says. "The first one was<br/>
devastating to me, but you learn."<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like geocaching, letterboxing began in England and migrated to<br/>
the United States primarily by way of an April 1998 article in<br/>
Smithsonian Magazine. In the hobby, planters place a homemade rubber<br/>
stamp in a box and hide it somewhere---in the woods, among the bricks<br/>
of an old building, on the Syracuse University campus. A logbook is<br/>
placed inside the box so people who find the package can leave a<br/>
"calling card".... their personal stamp on a page. Clues to the box's<br/>
location are then posted on the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia has already filled seven memo boxes with  images of stamps.<br/>
She has made some, while she collected others at letterboxing<br/>
gatherings,  where fellow enthusiasts often trade stamps among<br/>
themselves. Internet communities like www.atlasquest.com allow<br/>
planters and hunters to publicize new boxes, talk about the hobby and<br/>
organize letterboxing events. Atlasquest lists 125 letterboxes in the<br/>
Syracuse area.<br/>
<br/>
The most obvious art aspect of letterboxing can be seen as Cynthia<br/>
flips through one of her books of stamps, her collection of "miniature<br/>
folk art" The images encompass a wide subject matter and even broader<br/>
artistic temperament. Some stamps are simple etchings of animals.<br/>
Others are amateur in their carving.<br/>
<br/>
A few stand out. One of her favorite stamps is a tight shot focusing<br/>
on Tiger Woods' face, a single tear falling down his cheek. Two stamps<br/>
in her collection were carved by a fan of director Kevin Smith's movie<br/>
Dogma: a replica of the Mooby's sign and a tableau of Bartelby's wingspan.<br/>
<br/>
Emotional and physical investment enters into the carving process---it<br/>
takes Cynthia an evening to make a stamp---but artists can't get too<br/>
attached to their work. She makes copies of all her images, but even<br/>
then she has found it hard to put the finished product in a box and<br/>
hide it in the woods. "You have to let go," she says. "It's definately<br/>
a temporary art form."<br/>
<br/>
The Internet clues can be just as creative as the stamps. Cynthia's<br/>
Wonders series uses flowery language to describe landmarks. Instead of<br/>
a gazebo, she writes "shelter on the lake." A bridge becomes the "home<br/>
of the troll from the Three Billy Goats Gruff." For a box called "I<br/>
Need a Hero," Cynthia embedded the clues in a poem.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget Lichtinger works in the Career Development Center in the S.I.<br/>
Newhouse School of Public Communications at SU. While Cynthia devotes<br/>
her energy to making letterboxes, Lichtinger mostly looks for them.<br/>
"It gets you outside to go hiking," she says. Lichtinger has planted<br/>
eight boxes, two on campus. One of her clues asks searchers to think<br/>
about where the press "all began." Luchtinger says the best way to<br/>
learn about letterboxing is to get together with some friends. read<br/>
the rules on the Internet and just do it. At first I didn't quite<br/>
understand what it was all about,." she says. "Until you go out to do<br/>
it, you're kind of like, huh?"<br/>
<br/>
Losing a letterbox is a hazard, but some older boxers think spreading<br/>
the word of the sport contributes to the problem, she says. New<br/>
recruits don't know how to play the game and so they ruin it for<br/>
everybody. Traditionalists like the clandestine aspect of <br/>
letterboxing and were content to pass clues by word of mouth. <br/>
<br/>
"The whole thing is to try to be secretive," Cynthia says. "People<br/>
were saying letterboxing was something best shared by a whisper."<br/>
<br/>
She thinks this mistrust of beginners can be avoided if every new<br/>
pledge to letterboxing follows a few simple rules. First, be stealthy.<br/>
Drawing attention to a letterbox or simply rummaging around with a<br/>
notepad and a list of clues can draw attention. Once letterboxers find<br/>
a box they should check it out away from the hiding spot and re-hide<br/>
the box when people aren't around (Cynthia has whipped out her<br/>
cellphone or pretended to take pictures until people leave the area).<br/>
<br/>
"One of the rules, so to speak, is you have to be very inconspicuous,"<br/>
Lichtinger says. "You want to be very quiet about it."<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia also cautions people to Leave No Trace and respect the<br/>
environment around the box---this means no digging holes to hide<br/>
boxes. Finally, letterboxers should re-hide better than the original.<br/>
Some people get so excited about finding the box, they forget to hide<br/>
it carefully when they are done. <br/>
<br/>
"If people just did those three things, I think the naysayers of<br/>
publicity would be fine, " she says. "As it is right now, I just find<br/>
it too cool to keep to myself."</div>

on what happened.  <br/>
<br/>
As everyone in Central York now knows I work for Syracuse University,<br/>
S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in the Career Development<br/>
Center.  One of the programs we have is a Master's program in Arts<br/>
Journalism and this summer our office was invited to a luncheon to meet<br/>
with the master students starting the program.  Jon Voss, the reporter<br/>
who did the article in the New Times was one of the students at the<br/>
luncheon. During the luncheon I was chit chatting about my hobby as a<br/>
letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
Jon must of secured an internship with the New Times and decided to do<br/>
story on letterboxing because 1. he had a friend that letterboxed and 2.<br/>
he heard about it from someone who worked at SU (me). <br/>
<br/>
On September 11th, yes I remember specifically because my parents were<br/>
in town visiting from Ohio, Jon called me on my cell phone.  All my<br/>
contact information is listed in the staff directory.  When he called I<br/>
was at the Turning Stone Casino watching my parents playing a mind<br/>
numbing amount of slots and watching my inheritance go down the drain<br/>
(just kidding!!) and went out to the lobby to talk to Jon.  After the<br/>
conversation I totally forgot about the article until the discussion<br/>
about the Post Standard article - even then I had NO idea he would give<br/>
out as much info about me as he did.  Why?  I don't know because I am<br/>
idiot. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I take full responsibility for not saying UP FRONT not to use my<br/>
name and contact information. Although it is true he never asked if he<br/>
could print it and just did it, I should have known better.  Right now I<br/>
am kicking myself in the ass...hard.  The part that really bothers me is<br/>
the printing of the location of my stamp, which is thankfully only<br/>
upstairs from me so I can check on frequently and have the permission to<br/>
hide, but still. <br/>
<br/>
This has totally changed my mind about talking to press.  From now on,<br/>
my big ass mouth is shut. <br/>

was in<br/>

open and GASP!!!!  They were drinking coffee and eating sandwiches!!!!<br/>
 I'll never forget the day - it is etched in my mind, teachers are<br/>
people.  We all put our pants on one leg at a time, humans with<br/>
foibles and graces.<br/>
The article is getting rave reviews on AQ.  Thank you for sharing your<br/>

&gt; Jon must of secured an internship with the New Times and decided to do<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; On September 11th, yes I remember specifically because my parents were<br/>

&gt; Now, I take full responsibility for not saying UP FRONT not to use my<br/>

&gt; the printing of the location of my stamp, which is thankfully only<br/>
&gt; upstairs from me so I can check on frequently and have the permission to<br/>
&gt; hide, but still. <br/>

&gt;"The whole thing is to try to be secretive," Cynthia says. "People<br/>
&gt;were saying letterboxing was something best shared by a whisper."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;She thinks this mistrust of beginners can be avoided if every<br/>
&gt;new........<br/>
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It reads to me like a dislike of publicity is being equated directly<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;mistrust of beginners. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And to me, a newspaper is a strange place for the statement "The whole<br/>
&gt;thing is to try to be secretive". I'm sorry, but secretive doesn't<br/>
&gt;equate<br/>
&gt;with newspaper. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If Bridget gave her permission for her information to be published<br/>
&gt;that's<br/>
&gt;between her and the reporter, but I'd like to know if the University<br/>
&gt;officials knew about her boxes on campus, because if they didn't, they<br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt;now. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Alphabet Soup<br/>
&gt;&gt; Letterboxing is more than a rubber-stamp hobby by Jon Ross<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cynthia read the last clue and rounded the corner. She was in Upper<br/>
&gt;&gt; Onondaga Park in Strathmore, looking for the final letterbox in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wonders of Onondaga Park series, the first group of boxes she ever<br/>
&gt;&gt; planted. But instead of searching for the white plastic Wonder Bread<br/>
&gt;&gt; container, she spied the open box strewn over the rock steps.<br/>
&gt;Someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; had found the package and taken the materials--- a homemade stamp<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; a small notebook---leaving nothing but the shell of the letterbox. <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; "Sometimes I'll find a box and it will be chewed up," Cynthia says,<br/>
&gt;&gt; noting that animals uncover materials they come across, but that's<br/>
&gt;&gt; rare. "Almost always it's some person."<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cynthia, who doesn't use her full name but is known to the<br/>
&gt;&gt; letterboxing community as "Lock Wench," picked up the remains of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; box and headed back to the park entrance. This wasn't the first time<br/>
&gt;&gt; this had happened. "When you put a lot of work into a carving, it's<br/>
&gt;&gt; devastating when you find it trashed," she says. "The first one was<br/>
&gt;&gt; devastating to me, but you learn."<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sort of like geocaching, letterboxing began in England and migrated<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the United States primarily by way of an April 1998 article in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Smithsonian Magazine. In the hobby, planters place a homemade rubber<br/>
&gt;&gt; stamp in a box and hide it somewhere---in the woods, among the<br/>
&gt;bricks<br/>
&gt;&gt; of an old building, on the Syracuse University campus. A logbook is<br/>
&gt;&gt; placed inside the box so people who find the package can leave a<br/>
&gt;&gt; "calling card".... their personal stamp on a page. Clues to the<br/>
&gt;box's<br/>
&gt;&gt; location are then posted on the Internet.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cynthia has already filled seven memo boxes with  images of stamps.<br/>
&gt;&gt; She has made some, while she collected others at letterboxing<br/>
&gt;&gt; gatherings,  where fellow enthusiasts often trade stamps among<br/>
&gt;&gt; themselves. Internet communities like www.atlasquest.com allow<br/>
&gt;&gt; planters and hunters to publicize new boxes, talk about the hobby<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; organize letterboxing events. Atlasquest lists 125 letterboxes in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Syracuse area.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The most obvious art aspect of letterboxing can be seen as Cynthia<br/>
&gt;&gt; flips through one of her books of stamps, her collection of<br/>
&gt;"miniature<br/>
&gt;&gt; folk art" The images encompass a wide subject matter and even<br/>
&gt;broader<br/>
&gt;&gt; artistic temperament. Some stamps are simple etchings of animals.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Others are amateur in their carving.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; A few stand out. One of her favorite stamps is a tight shot focusing<br/>
&gt;&gt; on Tiger Woods' face, a single tear falling down his cheek. Two<br/>
&gt;stamps<br/>
&gt;&gt; in her collection were carved by a fan of director Kevin Smith's<br/>
&gt;movie<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dogma: a replica of the Mooby's sign and a tableau of Bartelby's<br/>
&gt;wingspan.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Emotional and physical investment enters into the carving<br/>
&gt;process---it<br/>
&gt;&gt; takes Cynthia an evening to make a stamp---but artists can't get too<br/>
&gt;&gt; attached to their work. She makes copies of all her images, but even<br/>
&gt;&gt; then she has found it hard to put the finished product in a box and<br/>
&gt;&gt; hide it in the woods. "You have to let go," she says. "It's<br/>
&gt;definately<br/>
&gt;&gt; a temporary art form."<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The Internet clues can be just as creative as the stamps. Cynthia's<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wonders series uses flowery language to describe landmarks. Instead<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; a gazebo, she writes "shelter on the lake." A bridge becomes the<br/>
&gt;"home<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the troll from the Three Billy Goats Gruff." For a box called "I<br/>
&gt;&gt; Need a Hero," Cynthia embedded the clues in a poem.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Bridget Lichtinger works in the Career Development Center in the<br/>
&gt;S.I.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Newhouse School of Public Communications at SU. While Cynthia<br/>
&gt;devotes<br/>
&gt;&gt; her energy to making letterboxes, Lichtinger mostly looks for them.<br/>
&gt;&gt; "It gets you outside to go hiking," she says. Lichtinger has planted<br/>
&gt;&gt; eight boxes, two on campus. One of her clues asks searchers to think<br/>

&gt;&gt; Losing a letterbox is a hazard, but some older boxers think<br/>

&gt;&gt; recruits don't know how to play the game and so they ruin it for<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; She thinks this mistrust of beginners can be avoided if every new<br/>
&gt;&gt; pledge to letterboxing follows a few simple rules. First, be<br/>
&gt;stealthy.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Drawing attention to a letterbox or simply rummaging around with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; notepad and a list of clues can draw attention. Once letterboxers<br/>
&gt;find<br/>
&gt;&gt; a box they should check it out away from the hiding spot and re-hide<br/>
&gt;&gt; the box when people aren't around (Cynthia has whipped out her<br/>
&gt;&gt; cellphone or pretended to take pictures until people leave the<br/>
&gt;area).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; "One of the rules, so to speak, is you have to be very<br/>
&gt;inconspicuous,"<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lichtinger says. "You want to be very quiet about it."<br/>

He got most of the facts right.<br/>
He emphasised some important topics.<br/>
The using quotes without being upfront about it is bad journalism for sure though.  But <br/>
Lockwench had nothing to do with that.<br/>
I wouldn't have started it the way he did...with a bad thing that can happen, that was weird.<br/>
I didn't like the writing, though I'm not opposed to press in general.<br/>

What he did was unprofessional and unacceptable but that is probably pretty<br/>
common behavior for a lot of reporters. I guess he's learning the "craft"<br/>
early. He'll probably go far. I'm glad it sounds like it won't have a<br/>

&gt; It reads to me like a dislike of publicity is being equated directly<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; mistrust of beginners. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And to me, a newspaper is a strange place for the statement "The whole<br/>

&gt; equate<br/>
&gt; with newspaper. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Alphabet Soup<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing is more than a rubber-stamp hobby by Jon Ross<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cynthia read the last clue and rounded the corner. She was in Upper<br/>
&gt; &gt; Onondaga Park in Strathmore, looking for the final letterbox in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wonders of Onondaga Park series, the first group of boxes she ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; planted. But instead of searching for the white plastic Wonder Bread<br/>
&gt; &gt; container, she spied the open box strewn over the rock steps.<br/>
&gt; Someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; had found the package and taken the materials--- a homemade stamp<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a small notebook---leaving nothing but the shell of the letterbox. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; "Sometimes I'll find a box and it will be chewed up," Cynthia says,<br/>
&gt; &gt; noting that animals uncover materials they come across, but that's<br/>
&gt; &gt; rare. "Almost always it's some person."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cynthia, who doesn't use her full name but is known to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing community as "Lock Wench," picked up the remains of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box and headed back to the park entrance. This wasn't the first time<br/>
&gt; &gt; this had happened. "When you put a lot of work into a carving, it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; devastating when you find it trashed," she says. "The first one was<br/>
&gt; &gt; devastating to me, but you learn."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sort of like geocaching, letterboxing began in England and migrated<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the United States primarily by way of an April 1998 article in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Smithsonian Magazine. In the hobby, planters place a homemade rubber<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp in a box and hide it somewhere---in the woods, among the<br/>
&gt; bricks<br/>
&gt; &gt; of an old building, on the Syracuse University campus. A logbook is<br/>
&gt; &gt; placed inside the box so people who find the package can leave a<br/>
&gt; &gt; "calling card".... their personal stamp on a page. Clues to the<br/>
&gt; box's<br/>
&gt; &gt; location are then posted on the Internet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cynthia has already filled seven memo boxes with  images of stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She has made some, while she collected others at letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; gatherings,  where fellow enthusiasts often trade stamps among<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves. Internet communities like www.atlasquest.com allow<br/>
&gt; &gt; planters and hunters to publicize new boxes, talk about the hobby<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; organize letterboxing events. Atlasquest lists 125 letterboxes in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Syracuse area.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The most obvious art aspect of letterboxing can be seen as Cynthia<br/>
&gt; &gt; flips through one of her books of stamps, her collection of<br/>
&gt; "miniature<br/>
&gt; &gt; folk art" The images encompass a wide subject matter and even<br/>
&gt; broader<br/>
&gt; &gt; artistic temperament. Some stamps are simple etchings of animals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Others are amateur in their carving.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few stand out. One of her favorite stamps is a tight shot focusing<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Tiger Woods' face, a single tear falling down his cheek. Two<br/>
&gt; stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; in her collection were carved by a fan of director Kevin Smith's<br/>
&gt; movie<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dogma: a replica of the Mooby's sign and a tableau of Bartelby's<br/>
&gt; wingspan.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Emotional and physical investment enters into the carving<br/>
&gt; process---it<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes Cynthia an evening to make a stamp---but artists can't get too<br/>
&gt; &gt; attached to their work. She makes copies of all her images, but even<br/>
&gt; &gt; then she has found it hard to put the finished product in a box and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hide it in the woods. "You have to let go," she says. "It's<br/>
&gt; definately<br/>
&gt; &gt; a temporary art form."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Internet clues can be just as creative as the stamps. Cynthia's<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wonders series uses flowery language to describe landmarks. Instead<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a gazebo, she writes "shelter on the lake." A bridge becomes the<br/>
&gt; "home<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the troll from the Three Billy Goats Gruff." For a box called "I<br/>
&gt; &gt; Need a Hero," Cynthia embedded the clues in a poem.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bridget Lichtinger works in the Career Development Center in the<br/>
&gt; S.I.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Newhouse School of Public Communications at SU. While Cynthia<br/>
&gt; devotes<br/>
&gt; &gt; her energy to making letterboxes, Lichtinger mostly looks for them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "It gets you outside to go hiking," she says. Lichtinger has planted<br/>
&gt; &gt; eight boxes, two on campus. One of her clues asks searchers to think<br/>
&gt; &gt; about where the press "all began." Luchtinger says the best way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn about letterboxing is to get together with some friends. read<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rules on the Internet and just do it. At first I didn't quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand what it was all about,." she says. "Until you go out to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, you're kind of like, huh?"<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Losing a letterbox is a hazard, but some older boxers think<br/>
&gt; spreading<br/>
&gt; &gt; the word of the sport contributes to the problem, she says. New<br/>
&gt; &gt; recruits don't know how to play the game and so they ruin it for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everybody. Traditionalists like the clandestine aspect of <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing and were content to pass clues by word of mouth. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; "The whole thing is to try to be secretive," Cynthia says. "People<br/>
&gt; &gt; were saying letterboxing was something best shared by a whisper."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; She thinks this mistrust of beginners can be avoided if every new<br/>
&gt; &gt; pledge to letterboxing follows a few simple rules. First, be<br/>
&gt; stealthy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drawing attention to a letterbox or simply rummaging around with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; notepad and a list of clues can draw attention. Once letterboxers<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; a box they should check it out away from the hiding spot and re-hide<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box when people aren't around (Cynthia has whipped out her<br/>
&gt; &gt; cellphone or pretended to take pictures until people leave the<br/>
&gt; area).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; "One of the rules, so to speak, is you have to be very<br/>
&gt; inconspicuous,"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lichtinger says. "You want to be very quiet about it."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cynthia also cautions people to Leave No Trace and respect the<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment around the box---this means no digging holes to hide<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes. Finally, letterboxers should re-hide better than the<br/>
&gt; original.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some people get so excited about finding the box, they forget to<br/>
&gt; hide<br/>
&gt; &gt; it carefully when they are done. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; "If people just did those three things, I think the naysayers of<br/>
&gt; &gt; publicity would be fine, " she says. "As it is right now, I just<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; it too cool to keep to myself."<br/>

&gt; Bridget and Cynthia,   Ack! you mean you are real people with real<br/>
&gt; names &amp; jobs?  A life outside of letterboxing?  I recall a time when I<br/>
&gt; was in<br/>
&gt; 10th grade and was walking past the teachers' lounge, the door swung<br/>
&gt; open and GASP!!!!  They were drinking coffee and eating sandwiches!!!!<br/>
&gt;  I'll never forget the day - it is etched in my mind, teachers are<br/>
&gt; people.  We all put our pants on one leg at a time, humans with<br/>
&gt; foibles and graces.<br/>
&gt; The article is getting rave reviews on AQ.  Thank you for sharing your<br/>
&gt;   the experiences with the press.  Don't be so hard on yourself!<br/>
&gt; Congratulations!  Norasta<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, since I have been outed so to speak, I will give the whole story<br/>
&gt; &gt; on what happened.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As everyone in Central York now knows I work for Syracuse University,<br/>
&gt; &gt; S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in the Career Development<br/>
&gt; &gt; Center.  One of the programs we have is a Master's program in Arts<br/>
&gt; &gt; Journalism and this summer our office was invited to a luncheon to meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the master students starting the program.  Jon Voss, the reporter<br/>
&gt; &gt; who did the article in the New Times was one of the students at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; luncheon. During the luncheon I was chit chatting about my hobby as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxer. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jon must of secured an internship with the New Times and decided to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; story on letterboxing because 1. he had a friend that letterboxed and 2.<br/>
&gt; &gt; he heard about it from someone who worked at SU (me). <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On September 11th, yes I remember specifically because my parents were<br/>
&gt; &gt; in town visiting from Ohio, Jon called me on my cell phone.  All my<br/>
&gt; &gt; contact information is listed in the staff directory.  When he called I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was at the Turning Stone Casino watching my parents playing a mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; numbing amount of slots and watching my inheritance go down the drain<br/>
&gt; &gt; (just kidding!!) and went out to the lobby to talk to Jon.  After the<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversation I totally forgot about the article until the discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the Post Standard article - even then I had NO idea he would give<br/>
&gt; &gt; out as much info about me as he did.  Why?  I don't know because I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; idiot. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, I take full responsibility for not saying UP FRONT not to use my<br/>
&gt; &gt; name and contact information. Although it is true he never asked if he<br/>
&gt; &gt; could print it and just did it, I should have known better.  Right now I<br/>

&gt; Welcome to the club, Bridget.  I think it's abhorrent what he did and I <br/>

&gt; damned publicity.  Zip it people and resist the 15 minutes of fame.<br/>
