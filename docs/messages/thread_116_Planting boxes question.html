backwards? <br/>

Someone posted on taking boxes with them to plant in another <br/>

All those kinds of things. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I <br/>

<br/>
First find your spot, a good spot &amp; try to imagine if it's a good <br/>
hidey-hole even when all the leaves are gone.  Then, after the box is <br/>
planted write the clues working backwards, double checking (even <br/>
triple checking) your right &amp; left's (I can't tell you how many times <br/>
I've written down left when it's been right!), # of steps, name of <br/>
path, etc.  Take lots of clue reference pictures so you have <br/>
something to look at when you're rewriting the clues.  For example: <br/>
if a tree growing in the middle of the trail is an indicator that 5 <br/>
feet beyond a small path is leading off to the left into a little <br/>
opening in the woods, and the box is hidden at the base of a "U" <br/>
shaped tree somewhere inside.  Digital images are a big help, almost <br/>
like being there.....and you can be as straight forward or ambiguous <br/>
as you want when writing up the clues.<br/>
<br/>
After the clues are written, if at all possible, go back and follow <br/>
the clues word by word to get the kinks out and see if there are any <br/>
mistakes or they need improving before publishing.  If you can't do <br/>
it then quite often someone will be happy to test them for you.<br/>
<br/>

Usually, some confusion or false lead is good fun, as long as it's able to <br/>

I think it's better to have someone else test your clues, simply because <br/>
they're in your wording and writing style, so you might understand them, but <br/>
others might not. Making sure your clues make sense by testing them will <br/>
make people appreciate your boxes more.<br/>

on the left or paved to the right?<br/>
