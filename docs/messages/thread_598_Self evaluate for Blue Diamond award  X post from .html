Just spent a rainy Sunday afternoon looking at the most prolific<br/>
planters in the Hall of Fame P100 club. Some of these folks have no<br/>
diamonds. They may have chosen not to participate, or their boxes have<br/>
few visitors or maybe they are just average or below average box<br/>
creators, no way of telling. Some of the P100's have lots of diamonds<br/>
esp if they have a travelling series, each box in the series gets a<br/>
diamond. The folks with the most diamonds not a part of a big series<br/>
are Green Tortuga, LightninBug, True Indigo, and Amanda in Seattle. I<br/>
know it is not supposed to be a competition but if one offers "Awards<br/>
of Excellence" to a limited number of people it IS a competition. Or<br/>
is the intent to really help boxers locate outstanding boxes? If so, I<br/>
have a suggestion that is a kinder way of identifying really good boxes.<br/>
I can understand that some boxers may appreciate the blue diamonds if<br/>
they are on a limited time budget and value the perceptions of other<br/>
boxers. I like many other folks have chosen not to be evaluated in<br/>

positive feedback on them. Other boxes I have created are OK. Soon I<br/>
hope to find some of LockWench's excellent boxes, none of which have<br/>
blue diamonds as she too has chosen to opt out of this feature. As my<br/>
time will be limited I will ask her which ones she recommends. Why not<br/>
allow folks to self evaluate? I would be much more likely to trust a<br/>
planter's opinion of their best boxes than someone who may or may not<br/>
share my criteria for excellence. Each boxer who wishes to do so could<br/>
identify their 3, 4 or 5 personal best boxes with a blue diamond. Or<br/>

of the BD's, that's why I'd prefer your own opinion<br/>

their rating. I looked thru my logbook to see which of<br/>
my finds had been bestowed the BD award.  Some made<br/>
sense (CraftyMouse's boxes) and others were just OK,<br/>
def not outstanding.  Some really cool boxes I've<br/>
found have no BD.  It's a useless and destructive<br/>
feature IMHO.  Until I can come to terms with this I<br/>
will only be listing my new boxes on LBNA.  I know I<br/>
should lighten up, but my favourite website is<br/>
experimenting with its supporters.  I feel like I'm in<br/>

 challenge himself, and he has obviously designed a complicated system that he is justifiably proud of. I just wish he would  play with his own toys and those of his close friends, and not MY boxes.

&gt; For those reasons, I have opted out. But I also<br/>
&gt; thought a lot about potentially driving too much<br/>
&gt; traffic to certain sensitive bd boxes, potentially<br/>
&gt; increased maintenance of bd boxes, and potentially<br/>
&gt; putting them at risk for someone wanting to<br/>
&gt; "collect" bd stamps. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I obviously have had more than my time at the mike<br/>
&gt; to voice these personal opinions on AQ..and I have<br/>
&gt; agreed to sit back and let the system work. I<br/>
&gt; suspect that Ryan just had a lot of time and<br/>
&gt; inclination  to develop this system and see if it<br/>
&gt; could fly. I do admire his willingness to challenge<br/>
&gt; himself, and he has obviously designed a complicated<br/>
&gt; system that he is justifiably proud of. I just wish<br/>
&gt; he would  play with his own toys and those of his<br/>
&gt; close friends, and not MY boxes. To his credit, he<br/>
&gt; has agreed to let people opt out of this experiment.<br/>
&gt;  People have a perfect  right to decide if they want<br/>
&gt; to be a guinea pig or test case and to grade the<br/>
&gt; boxes of neighbors, friends and children. I say, no<br/>
&gt; thanks.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Blue Diamond excellence award or popularity<br/>
&gt; contest?<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Just spent a rainy Sunday afternoon looking at<br/>
&gt; the most prolific<br/>
&gt;  &gt; planters in the Hall of Fame P100 club. Some of<br/>
&gt; these folks have no<br/>
&gt;  &gt; diamonds. They may have chosen not to<br/>
&gt; participate, or their boxes <br/>
&gt;  have<br/>
&gt;  &gt; few visitors or maybe they are just average or<br/>
&gt; below average box<br/>
&gt;  &gt; creators, no way of telling. Some of the P100's<br/>
&gt; have lots of <br/>
&gt;  diamonds<br/>
&gt;  &gt; esp if they have a travelling series, each box in<br/>
&gt; the series gets a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; diamond. The folks with the most diamonds not a<br/>
&gt; part of a big series<br/>
&gt;  &gt; are Green Tortuga, LightninBug, True Indigo, and<br/>
&gt; Amanda in Seattle. <br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt;  &gt; know it is not supposed to be a competition but<br/>
&gt; if one <br/>
&gt;  offers "Awards<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of Excellence" to a limited number of people it<br/>
&gt; IS a competition. Or<br/>
&gt;  &gt; is the intent to really help boxers locate<br/>
&gt; outstanding boxes? If <br/>
&gt;  so, I<br/>
&gt;  &gt; have a suggestion that is a kinder way of<br/>
&gt; identifying really good <br/>
&gt;  boxes.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I can understand that some boxers may appreciate<br/>
&gt; the blue diamonds <br/>
&gt;  if<br/>
&gt;  &gt; they are on a limited time budget and value the<br/>
&gt; perceptions of other<br/>
&gt;  &gt; boxers. I like many other folks have chosen not<br/>
&gt; to be evaluated in<br/>
&gt;  &gt; this way. Some of my boxes are really good and I<br/>
&gt; have received lots <br/>
&gt;  of<br/>
&gt;  &gt; positive feedback on them. Other boxes I have<br/>
&gt; created are OK. Soon I<br/>
&gt;  &gt; hope to find some of LockWench's excellent boxes,<br/>
&gt; none of which have<br/>
&gt;  &gt; blue diamonds as she too has chosen to opt out of<br/>
&gt; this feature. As <br/>
&gt;  my<br/>
&gt;  &gt; time will be limited I will ask her which ones<br/>
&gt; she recommends. Why <br/>
&gt;  not<br/>
&gt;  &gt; allow folks to self evaluate? I would be much<br/>
&gt; more likely to trust a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; planter's opinion of their best boxes than<br/>
&gt; someone who may or may <br/>
&gt;  not<br/>
&gt;  &gt; share my criteria for excellence. Each boxer who<br/>
&gt; wishes to do so <br/>
&gt;  could<br/>
&gt;  &gt; identify their 3, 4 or 5 personal best boxes with<br/>
&gt; a blue diamond. Or<br/>
&gt;  &gt; maybe a percentage of their plants if that's not<br/>
&gt; too complicated. <br/>
&gt;  I'm<br/>
&gt;  &gt; not asking for another feature! Just tweak the<br/>
&gt; existing one to <br/>
&gt;  return<br/>
&gt;  &gt; AQ to the kinder friendlier site that it once<br/>
&gt; was. Share the <br/>
&gt;  diamonds,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; there should be lots to go around.  Nor<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>

diamonds as well?  Those are really strong words.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously guys... you can opt out, if it's meaningless<br/>
then let it be meaningless and let it be....  Ryan<br/>
himself has said it's going to take a few weeks to<br/>
really see what the system has to offer, I can't<br/>
believe we're *still* talking about this!  And not<br/>
listing your boxes on AQ because you don't like Ryan's<br/>
programming? Er.  Ok.  Your choice.  If you don't mind<br/>
missing out on all the other features AQ has to offer,<br/>
then you probably won't miss it at all.  I guess we're<br/>
just lucky to have TWO sites so people who are miffed<br/>
at one can go post on the other.  And alternate back<br/>
and forth, should the miffs start to come both<br/>
ways....  better hope Choi never changes a thing over<br/>
there b/c I'm sure SOMEONE will take offense...<br/>
<br/>
For someone who puts an incredible amount of personal<br/>
energy and passion into letterboxing, Ryan really<br/>
hasn't been cut a whole lot of slack here, including<br/>
dire predictions about his motives.<br/>
<br/>
This whole thing kind of reminds ME of what I don't<br/>
like about letterboxing.... the fits.  I fled off the<br/>
big list during a few big hissy fits and flaming of<br/>
anything that wasn't "Good ol'" letterboxing (meaning,<br/>
whatever letterboxing was, when THAT person joined, of<br/>
course... since going back to Dartmoor days would<br/>
uh... be... UnAmerican or whatever)<br/>
<br/>
LET'S.  ALL.  CHILL.  CHIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLL.  :-) <br/>
Ahhhhhhh.  Much better.<br/>
<br/>
IF in three weeks we're all still het up about it,<br/>
then fine, protest away.  Lynch Ryan.  Boycott AQ. <br/>
(Do you think the numbers will even blip a tiny<br/>
bit?)But let the experiment have it's chance to work<br/>
the evil magic on the mindless experimentees that will<br/>
be manipulated towards BD addiction and THEN see if<br/>
that really comes true.<br/>

Anyone can go back practically to the beginning of the AQ archives and see how much I support him and his work. I like the guy, greatly admire his work and dedication, but HATE this one feature out of dozens of features on that site.  Not enough to dump AQ, but enough to keep me from using the feature and I appreciate Ryan adding the "opt out" choice.

I use lists,  and notes and logged finds/plants to assist my wholly inadequate memory. I only mentioned that I knew how the British felt. CHANGES are  hard. But changes don't have to be inevitable either. Ryan started AQ for fun. But when he started listing boxes other than his own and a few friends and started accepting a fee for premium members, it's no longer a game or a hobby. It is a business. Personally, I love the site and hopes he does well with it. I am on a renewable membership, myself..which means I have committed my funds to his project for
 many years to come.  But our boxes, our comments/posts, and our planned events are what drives business to that site. So we should have a say too.</span><br/></div><div> <br/> LET'S.  ALL.  CHILL.

Neither the site nor the hobby needs ::::any:::::: more tweaking or<br/>

<div>That's messed up.  I think it's a perfect example of this whole thing just not being through through all the way. It was ......oh....cool.............let's have blue diamonds! That's really sad that the kid feels that way. I hope someone can explain things to him so he doesn't get his feelings hurt. </div>

<div><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">I meant my words to be strong.  That's the group I tend to box with...neighbors, friends and children.  I found one 13 year old boy on the computer checking each day if his box had a BD yet. He was proud as heck of it and was poignantly logging in each day to see if his box passed muster. Don't kids get measured/tested and graded enough these days? Can't a nice note from a finder suffice as a pat on the back? Or personal pride?  I guess not..when there is any chance you can be ranked among your peers.

That one gets a very special award in a very special shape!!<br/>But it ain't no freakin' diamond!! lol <br/><br/>&gt; FWIW, I have no clue why any of our boxes would rate a blue diamond. <br/>&gt; It is certainly not what we aspire to (we try to make fun and <br/>&gt; challenging boxes, that's pretty much it), but Miss Moon may comment <br/>&gt; on a personal favorite in eastern PA with a very special tree nearby.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I have a good image of Lucky the Leprechaun ready for transfer <br/>&gt; and carving for the "Always After Me Blue Diamonds" box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lightnin' Bug + Tony Tony Chopper<br/>&gt; Allentown, PA<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/>
