I hope you all survived the extravaganza by Cayuga Lake.  Two things <br/>
prevented us from adding a PA flavor - my job and an illness in the <br/>
family!  I wish my central NY brethren the best and will hope to see <br/>
perhaps some of you when we invade for the Finger Lakes Wine Festival <br/>
in mid-July at the Glen....<br/>
