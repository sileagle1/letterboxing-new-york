The plant life on Kauai is so incredible that I'm not even able to differentiate between "this is an amazing plant" and "oh, this thing?  It grows everywhere!"  But I think it is better to be innocent, that way.  I've always thought that the difference between a wildflower and a weed was rather arbitrary, with  the plants that are easy to grow being called weeds (ignoring the issue of invasive species for the moment).  If dandelions or honeysuckle were difficult to grow, people would be developing hybrids, and selling them for big bucks.  I try to enjoy all but the most prickly or dangerous plants, and enjoy those types at a slightly greater distance!<br/>

of opposing dark green shiny leaves. <br/>

As a lei: <a href="https://www.royalhawaiianleis.com/Traditional/Maile.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.royalhawaiianleis.com/Traditional/Maile.html</a>  You can <br/>
see and smell maile leis at almost any florist lei stand on the islands.<br/>
<br/>
I was taught that a weed was any plant that grew where it was unwanted. A <br/>
rose would be a weed in a dandelion garden.<br/>
<br/>
A plant that we grow as an ornamental, in the States, lantana, is highly <br/>
invasive and problematic in Hawaii. They form slightly prickly large <br/>
trailing tangles.<br/>
