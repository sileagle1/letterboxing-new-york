the clues to your LBNA clue page, or your own home page. It also lets <br/>
you keep track of all your P's and F's, including virtual, HHs and <br/>
travelers. Also has a hall of fame for 25 and 50 P's &amp; F's, but if <br/>
the box you found hasn't been logged by the creator yet, you can't <br/>
post it as a find.<br/>

Everyone sign up quick! :-)<br/>
