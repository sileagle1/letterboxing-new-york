letterboxing and we knew it was right up our alley. We like to do <br/>
moderate hikes and walks with our minpin and I love puzzles. The <br/>
article was  in the paper the last weekend in October and we got our <br/>
stuff together and began. We've only found two boxes, just very busy <br/>
with life. Now that hunting season has begun and they've already shot <br/>
a school and two other hunters, we probably won't be going into the <br/>
woods. Time to figure out where to plant and make stamps. Now that I <br/>
know more(a little) the article actually gave away one location which <br/>
is a no-no, but I'm glad we saw it, and began this hobby. Wayne, Lynn <br/>

</span></blockquote>We bought some inexpensive blaze orange fleece snap-on vests at Dick's<br/>
that work well for us. Hunting is permitted in lots of the state parks<br/>
so we're avoiding them completely right now, but we wear the vests<br/>
even if we're on the Finger Lakes Trail or in parks where hunting is<br/>
prohibited. Not every hunter is a conscientious or law-abiding hunter,<br/>
plus there's no way for us to know if the trail we're on happens to<br/>
border private hunting property (and there's plenty of that around<br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
In addition to wearing the blaze orange, we also avoid<br/>
wearing/carrying earth tone colors, especially browns, blacks and<br/>
white, when we're out hiking at this time of year. I usually run<br/>
screaming from garishly colored wardrobe choices, but come fall and<br/>
hunting season, the brighter and less natural-colored the better!<br/>

of this week since I have been hearing gun shots all around the fields near<br/>
my home.  I no longer will go out into the "wilderness" without someone in<br/>
our party wearing the orange gear.    Like was said before - not every<br/>
hunter is conscientious or law-abiding - some are out there totally drunk!!!<br/>
