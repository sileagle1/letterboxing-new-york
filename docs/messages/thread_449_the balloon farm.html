remington twice was a mistake. <br/>
we do new housing photos for draw inspections per bank requests.  takes us all over oneida,<br/>
herkimer, madison and otsego counties.  nice for letterboxing.  <br/>
today we went to jordonville so stopped at van hornesville boxes but there was too much snow. <br/>
headed down to the balloon farm and was I glad cause tuesday's wind had blown the box out of the<br/>
shrub.  It is now nicely tucked away. <br/>

One of my kids favorite places to play; just like when I was young.  <br/>

Thanks for replanting the Balloon box.I actually had planned to secure <br/>
it with my tiny bungee cords but realized I had left them home. Next <br/>
time I am out that way I will bring one. I wish the photo on the clue <br/>
page were bigger.It's really a cool photo of all their balloons flying <br/>
all over the yard. I might have to blow it up and re-add it.<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on the first finders!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-635775084">OK..it only took me three separate trips but I finally got all of the <br/>
Christmas Story stamps by budgie. I knew the location well, as I have <br/>
my own Woodchuck Hill stamp there...and found the first one with no <br/>
problem. But 2 was so confusing! There are many a couple of cedar <br/>
groves, several stone walls, many trail signs and even several moss-<br/>
covered wedge shaped stones! I DID find a geocache (I see you did <br/>
too, SpudHund! and even got a travel bug! I had no swag with me so <br/>
left $2 in the cache instead. I am a geocacher as well but I prefer <br/>
letterboxing.) The weather turned bad, so I left for the day.  I got <br/>
my sister to go back out with me yesterday when the sun came out. Of <br/>
course, half way down the trail the sun disappeared and the wind <br/>
started howling...and then the rain came. HARD. I was nearly soaked <br/>
but still managed to eliminate some potential box locations. <br/>
<br/>
Today I woke up very early to a brilliant blue sky and no wind. I <br/>
went back and this time came in from the opposite direction. Ah, just <br/>
as I thought. More stone walls, wedge shaped rocks, etc. Finally <br/>
managed to find "slippery rock" and that did it for me. A very good <br/>
hide. So I am happy to say I have all 3 stamps from that series now. <br/>
Thanks for the adventure!<br/>

But it was my first plant so I promise I will do better next time.  Tonight I am going to edit my clues so they are correct and people won't be cursing the day I was born. :-)  Thanks to Spudhound from helping me with the edit.<br/>

Did have fun on the trail because we came across Craftymouse, J.A.P and Seeker!! It was so nice to everyone out on a beautiful day like today.   <br/>
