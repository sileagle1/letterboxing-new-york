Turtle's Fear Faketor was! We took Celtic Quinn, Green Star and Silver <br/>
Dragon with us and we got a good 70 boxes in two days! We also REALLY <br/>
loved the night boxing (and plan to rip off...er, BORROW that idea for <br/>
a gathering near Halloween, if possible!). Wilcox Park really showed <br/>
off the Catskills to full effect and even with the little bit of rain <br/>
the last night, we didn't feel a drop.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to TT and her whole gang..we're exhausted but happy!<br/>

P.S.--We're also feeling proud to be one of the few that attempted <br/>
Acrophobia...we'll bring a heart machine next time, but we rock for <br/>
now...legends in our own mind!!! :-)</div>
