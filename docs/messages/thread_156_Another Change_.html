(mystery)letterbox, I have had to change the directions yet again! <br/>
These roads are minimum maintenance dirt roads and poor weather and <br/>
heavy ATV traffic quickly alter their condition. Before setting out <br/>
(ie. that morning), check clues on my website to see if there has been <br/>
an update on any road conditions so I don't have to post changes here <br/>
again! I will do my best to check on them and certainly would <br/>
appreciate your feedback too! My apologies again for the change!<br/>
