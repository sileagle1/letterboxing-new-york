the Syracuse New Times on Oct. 25th. Yes, I spoke to the writer and<br/>
raved about what a wonderful hobby this was..bringing together all<br/>
generations and getting people outdoors and exercising, as well as<br/>
learning about their local history and other cool topics. I stressed<br/>
over and over the "rules" of this hobby..be stealthy while boxing,<br/>
leave no trace, and replant the box better than you found it. We<br/>
talked about all sorts of things and he also went boxing with me..and<br/>
we even discovered one of my boxes muggled...so I think he "gets" it.<br/>
Time ( and editing ) will tell. I also told him I didn't care what<br/>
else got cut out as long as those three rules made the article.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I thought it would only be fair to give Central New<br/>
York boxers a warning so that they could add F-restrictions, go WOM or<br/>
pull their boxes. I know how much some of you NY boxers hate to cater<br/>
to newbies that come out of the woodwork after anyone shares this<br/>
hobby with others in a public forum.<br/>

<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">(I apologize in advance if I am 
misinterpreting you :-) )  I think you are doing a disservice to the 
discussion about publicity and those boxers who might not agree with 
you when you categorize some as 'hating to cater to new boxers'.  Not 
agreeing with overt publicity does not necessarily imply that a person is 
'anti-new boxer' and I would hate for new boxers, even if they find the hobby 
through public methods, reading this list to think that.  Of all 
the people I know involved in this hobby, I don't know a single one who wouldn't 
take the time to talk and explain politely and patiently to a new boxer who is 
open to learning, the basic and/or arcane aspects of this hobby.  
</font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">I hardly think that wanting this hobby 
passed wom from experience boxer to new boxer, keeping boxes safe from the 
mishandling, mis-hiding, over-enthusiastic new boxers, not well-versed in hiding 
techniques means we 'hate to cater to newbies', however, I do appreciate your 
warning about the pending article.  I think the fact that you felt you have 
to warn us, supplies some credence to the non-publicity 
stance.</font></div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1654042510">Actually, you DID misinterpret me. I am well aware that anti-publicity<br/>
and anti-newbie do not go hand in hand. I  have been a moderator of<br/>
this board since it was LBCNY, I'm a letterboxing blogger and have<br/>
been an active poster on Atlasquest for some time...and often talk<br/>
about my own personal takes on various letterboxing topics. Because of<br/>
this, I get a large volume of mail from every direction  (most of it<br/>
from the NY area) and some of it is quite heated. I heard from several<br/>
 NY people that were not happy I agreed to speak to a reporter and<br/>
mentioned they would pull their boxes or clues to avoid "catering to<br/>
newbies that come out of the woodwork after letterboxing has been<br/>
discussed in a public forum." That is a DIRECT QUOTE I got from one of<br/>
the angry/concerned boxers, although others said basically the same<br/>
thing. But  I also believe its perfectly within a boxer's right to<br/>
pull his boxes or clues if he feels his boxes might be threatened. I<br/>
disagree, but that doesn't mean I don't respect his right to have a<br/>
differing opinion. Let me be clear here,  I DON'T feel a warning by me<br/>
"supplies credence to a non-publicity stance." I warned people as a<br/>
COURTESY  to those who DO feel a warning is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I have posted here for over a year, held events where I  greeted<br/>
and/or helped every newbie, have attended gatherings where I helped<br/>
the host(s) greet and/or help every newbie, met privately with new<br/>
boxers to escort them around town to some boxes, met with visiting<br/>
newbies to bring them to some of my local boxes when they contacted me<br/>
(some from as far away as Georgia), put up new boxers in my own home,<br/>
gave away hundreds of dollars of lock n locks paid with my own money<br/>
just so new ( and old!)people could try them, repaired boxes on the<br/>
trail for newbies, helped newbies write their clues, tested directions<br/>
for them, etc etc etc.  So I am pretty soft when it comes to newbies,<br/>
as you can tell! LOL  But I am THRILLED  to hear that you feel the<br/>
same way and are "willing to take the time to talk and explain<br/>
politely and patiently to new boxers who are open to learning the<br/>
basics and/or arcane aspects of this hobby." I would welcome the help<br/>
at the Desperately Seeking Sun gather, if you  ( or anyone else) can<br/>
make it.  I am expecting a LOT of newbies at that gather and they<br/>
wouldn't have had much experience boxing before the snow fell. Did I<br/>
mention that the County is allowing dogs in the lodge this year?  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if you felt lumped into the "hates catering to newbies."<br/>
That was not my intent. But if you truly want, as you say:  "this<br/>
hobby passed wom from  experienced boxer to experienced boxer, keeping<br/>
boxes safe from the mishandling, mis-hiding, of over-enthusiastic new<br/>
boxers not well-versed in hiding techniques" than I don't see why an<br/>
local article will stop you from enjoying the hobby your way. WOM is<br/>
your full right!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting -<br/>

<p>Actually, you DID misinterpret me. I am well aware that 
  anti-publicity<br/>and anti-newbie do not go hand in hand. I have been a 
  moderator of<br/>this board since it was LBCNY, I'm a letterboxing blogger and 
  have<br/>been an active poster on Atlasquest for some time...and often 
  talk<br/>about my own personal takes on various letterboxing topics. Because 
  of<br/>this, I get a large volume of mail from every direction (most of 
  it<br/>from the NY area) and some of it is quite heated. I heard from 
  several<br/>NY people that were not happy I agreed to speak to a reporter 
  and<br/>mentioned they would pull their boxes or clues to avoid "catering 
  to<br/>newbies that come out of the woodwork after letterboxing has 
  been<br/>discussed in a public forum." That is a DIRECT QUOTE I got from one 
  of<br/>the angry/concerned boxers, although others said basically the 
  same<br/>thing. But I also believe its perfectly within a boxer's right 
  to<br/>pull his boxes or clues if he feels his boxes might be threatened. 
  I<br/>disagree, but that doesn't mean I don't respect his right to have 
  a<br/>differing opinion. Let me be clear here, I DON'T feel a warning by 
  me<br/>"supplies credence to a non-publicity stance." I warned people as 
  a<br/>COURTESY to those who DO feel a warning is necessary.<br/><br/>I have 
  posted here for over a year, held events where I greeted<br/>and/or helped 
  every newbie, have attended gatherings where I helped<br/>the host(s) greet 
  and/or help every newbie, met privately with new<br/>boxers to escort them 
  around town to some boxes, met with visiting<br/>newbies to bring them to some 
  of my local boxes when they contacted me<br/>(some from as far away as 
  Georgia), put up new boxers in my own home,<br/>gave away hundreds of dollars 
  of lock n locks paid with my own money<br/>just so new ( and old!)people could 
  try them, repaired boxes on the<br/>trail for newbies, helped newbies write 
  their clues, tested directions<br/>for them, etc etc etc. So I am pretty soft 
  when it comes to newbies,<br/>as you can tell! LOL But I am THRILLED to hear 
  that you feel the<br/>same way and are "willing to take the time to talk and 
  explain<br/>politely and patiently to new boxers who are open to learning 
  the<br/>basics and/or arcane aspects of this hobby." I would welcome the 
  help<br/>at the Desperately Seeking Sun gather, if you ( or anyone else) 
  can<br/>make it. I am expecting a LOT of newbies at that gather and 
  they<br/>wouldn't have had much experience boxing before the snow fell. Did 
  I<br/>mention that the County is allowing dogs in the lodge this year? 
  :)<br/><br/>I am sorry if you felt lumped into the "hates catering to 
  newbies."<br/>That was not my intent. But if you truly want, as you say: 
  "this<br/>hobby passed wom from experienced boxer to experienced boxer, 
  keeping<br/>boxes safe from the mishandling, mis-hiding, of over-enthusiastic

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1022192262">Thanks for clarifying, LockWench. After reading your post I was afraid too, that you thought that those of us who dislike overt publicity about Letterboxing were also inherantly anti-Newbie.  I hadn't read anything that strong even with all the debates going on, so I wondered where it was coming from.   Not that I can speak for the person who privately emailed you, but I remember reading somewhere (on this board? AQ? The ADK or Oswego LB Boards? Hmm) -- a Boxer was saying that he (she?) disliked published articles because the people who read them and suddenly thought, "Hey, this is a great thing!" all of a sudden start printing clues, going out searching, without researching the ettiquette and "how to's" and then make a mess of the boxes because they hadn't researched the in's and out's of letterboxing properly. Maybe that was what they meant. I can certainly understand that line of thinking-how it would be frustrating, I mean.  However, I hope they didn't mean they hate ALL newbies, because we were ALL new boxers once. Heck, I've been boxing for about 2 years and I'm not going to brag--I STILL consider myself a Newbie in several aspects of letterboxing (like compass reading! ARRRRR I just CANNOT figure it out! :oP). <br/>
<br/>
You are very generous to spend so much time out and about teaching new boxers. I have to admit, that's not a strong point of mine.  I hate to sound too much like a total recluse, but I'm just uncomfortable around people I really don't know- unless there is a computer screen or phone line between us, LOL.  I guess that's what I like most about letterboxing... for me it is a solitary endeavor, just me and my dogs.   I don't mind emailing, or answering LB questions that come in from the boxing part of my website (I get them a lot), but face-to-face meeting and greeting is a lot for me to take. LOL, I guess I am definitely more of an animal person than a people person! :o) It is much more comfortable for me to put stuff up on a website than try to explain something face to face, with my stuttering and stammering issues I would make a bad impression anyway. Ah well.  We each have our own strengths and weaknesses, I guess. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Hey...on an unrelated note...  I see you are signed up for NaNoWriMo!!!! Are you excited? Do you have your story line all set? 7 days to go!<br/>
