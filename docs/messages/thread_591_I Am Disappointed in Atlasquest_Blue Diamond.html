user friendly interface and incredibly responsive webmaster, Ryan<br/>
Carpenter (the Green Tortuga), today I was crushed to see a certain<br/>
new feature  on the site.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I LOVE the new search features he has implemented and<br/>
the new limited time only icon! Now I can finally mark the couple of<br/>
boxes I have that are out for the holiday season only.<br/>
<br/>
But I am appalled by the new "coveted" Blue Diamond feature. For those<br/>
of you who don't know what I am talking about, you can check AQ Post<br/>
#38869, and my own response #38874.  I fear this feature will do more<br/>
to destroy this game than the hot potato called Publicity ever will. I<br/>
welcome all your comments on this board....and would love someone to<br/>
give me a fresh perspective. Keep it clean, but I really want to hear<br/>
how you all feel about this new system. Would you use it when you are<br/>
deciding which boxes to find? Would you use personal recommendations<br/>
instead? A combination of both? How would you feel if your box earned<br/>
a "coveted" Blue Diamond? How would you feel if it didn't? Inquiring<br/>
minds want to know....<br/>

<br/>

it.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think there is little chance that the feature will<br/>
go away now that it's here, but yes, I see this<br/>
turning more competitive, etc.  Sigh. <br/>

beside your boxes. All it means is enough people felt that certain <br/>
box was more special than most, for whatever reason. Yes, the ratings <br/>
of those who blindly give 1's across the board can skew the ratings <br/>
just as much as those who give 10's across the board. People should <br/>
not give their 'friends' high scores just because they like them, <br/>
respect them, want to thank them. That is the only "issue" I see with <br/>
the concept; people have to learn to give an honest opinion, which a <br/>
lot cannot unfortunately. <br/>

I guess I just see this entire concept as more useful for non locals <br/>
than locals since locals are likely to search for them all eventually <br/>
anyway.<br/>

Opting out really does nothing other than NOT let people know that <br/>
others found it special.<br/>

thought just makes me cringe...and I am a bit surprised it was<br/>
implemented considering the history and uproar rating systems have<br/>
caused. Already boxes are being thought of in terms of their<br/>
suckability instead of boxes not found.  Personally I'd rather have my<br/>
boxes thought of as those that suck than found on a print-out of some<br/>
excited person bent on nabbing as many 'blue diamonds' they can in<br/>
so many hours.  Rush, rush, rush, gotta rush!  This past year we've<br/>
found so many boxes left laying out, little or no effort to cover<br/>
them, in some cases the plastic literally glowing in the woods.  It's<br/>
not that I'm against growth, I just have a problem with the<br/>
carelessness and lack of rehiding.  I fear this rating system will<br/>
only add to the problem.                                             <br/>
