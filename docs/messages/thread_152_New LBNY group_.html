hike for most of us. So, after dumping the ripoff that was that Meetup <br/>
group thing, the Highlander and I made a Yahoo group for the Buffalo <br/>
and Rochester area boxers<br/>
<br/>
Please don't take this the wrong way, either! I'll still be posting <br/>
here and checking these boards ('cause I love the Question of the <br/>
Week!), but I thought it would be cool to know that when someone <br/>
posts "Hey, we're gonna box a little this weekend...who wants to join <br/>
us?" we'd know that we're within driving distance! ;-) <br/>
<br/>
We'd be terribly honored to have everyone that posts here join our <br/>
group, too (since most of you are no more than 2 or 3 hours away from <br/>
us), so don't be shy...stop on by!<br/>
