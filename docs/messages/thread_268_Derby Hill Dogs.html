                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1818579477">Greeting everyone!  I am new to letterboxing in this area.  I moved <br/>
here a couple of years ago (after a divorce) and just started to get <br/>
into boxing around here.  I truly enjoy the people, places, and <br/>
locations in the Mexico, NY area.  I have worked with the Derby Hill <br/>
Bird Observatory almost from the day I moved to NY.  Birds are my <br/>
peace.  We work VERY VERY hard as to NOT upset any of our feathered <br/>
friends, and although dogs are great (I own two), you need to be <br/>
careful in bringing them here.  Our mission @ DHBO is: <br/>
To contribute to the preservation of raptor species which migrate <br/>
through Northeastern America.<br/>
The collection of data each spring on the numbers of raptors (hawks) <br/>
migrating past Derby Hill using guidelines established by the USFW.<br/>
Provision of information and education to the general public about <br/>
raptors, other species of birds and the importance of habitat <br/>
preservation.<br/>
Provision of Derby Hill Bird Observatory as a site for amateurs and <br/>
professionals to study and enjoy raptor migration.<br/>
<br/>
*****As for CONTACTING people within the organization about <br/>
letterboxes, DO NOT DO IT!!  Do not mention the hiding of unnatural <br/>
items within the boundries.  YES, we want people to visit it.  In <br/>
the Spring, you can't find a spot, but be sure, we, as an org., <br/>
GREATLY frown upon folks snooping around and being destructive, <br/>
while looking for one of my great joys, letterboxes.  Use common <br/>
sense.  Don't be THAT person.  Enjoy DHBO.  Go find all those <br/>
wonderful boxes over there.  Have a great time, but be careful about <br/>
how you do it, and to whom you talk to about it.<br/>
<br/>
With all that being said, and I sound kind of like a jerk (I'm not.  <br/>
Just passionate), I look forward to seeing you all on the trail or <br/>
at DH.  Your friend in letterboxes, lbcnyer</div>
