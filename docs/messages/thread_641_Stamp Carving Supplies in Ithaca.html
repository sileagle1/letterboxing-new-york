We have been letterboxing for over a month now and we have carved our<br/>
signature stamp and have also carved a stamp for our first planted<br/>
letterbox.  We love doing this and want to get on with carving more<br/>
stamps so we can get out and plant some more, but we looked in the big<br/>
craft stores in Ithaca and couldn't find any carving blocks.  Does<br/>
anybody know anywhere in the Ithaca area that sells them??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

bookstore stocks the pink stuff from time to time. Also, McNamara's near <br/>
the mall sometimes carries Mastercarve erasers. I've switched to PZKut, <br/>
though, so local availability doesn't matter any more. It's much more <br/>
affordable and a great carving material, plus the owner is an avid <br/>
letterboxer. She also sells carving materials besides just carving medium, <br/>
things like thick foam to back your stamps and carving blades.<br/>

She can fit 4 sheets into one priority mail envelope, which helps reduce <br/>
the shipping portion of the cost. If you don't want 4 sheets, you might <br/>
find someone in the area willing to split an order with you.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun carving, and enjoy this warm weather as you go out boxing!<br/>
