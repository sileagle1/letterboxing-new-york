<br/>
My husband (Guitar Guy) and I accidentally found a letter box a few<br/>
weeks ago (Bugs Along the Mohawk), and we came home and did some<br/>
research on what letter boxing is.  Well, we're in it now!  We're<br/>
excited to have a new hobby we can participate in, and we hope to meet<br/>
some nice people here, too.<br/>
<br/>
A little background about us: My name is Mary, I'm 33, and I am an<br/>
elementary school teacher in Oriskany, NY.  Nate is 31, and works at<br/>
HCCC in the science department.  Our other hobbies include birding,<br/>
fishing (how we found the Bugs box!), camping, hiking, snowshoeing;<br/>
Nate collects and plays guitar; Mary collects and plays WITH<br/>
Strawberry Shortcake dolls!  At this time, we have no children, but we<br/>
have 11 pets, including cats, lizards, turtles, a snake, a tarantula,<br/>
tropical fish, a hamster, and a mouse.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to introduce myself, thank Paul for inviting me to join,<br/>
and say hello to everyone!  Thanks for having such neat boxes around<br/>
here.  We're really enjoying ourselves so far!<br/>

Welcome to LbNY!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you realize that 2 students at your school are young <br/>
letterboxers. They are Grant &amp; Dean Mealey, my great-nephews, and <br/>
they've both planted boxes, too! Maybe you've been their teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Their mother (my niece), Deidre, planted "Bugs Along the Mohawk"!<br/>
<br/>
My other niece, Darlene, lives in Whitesboro and is also a <br/>
letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very small world, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Paul<br/>

.  May I ask you, just out of personal curiosity, how does one accidentally
find a letterbox.  Were you sitting and happened to glance over and see it
sticking out of its hiding place?  While my better half Lascivious Lion or
Box Hound as he’s usually called has the uncanny ability to stand within
30 feet of a box and “smell” the plastic… not really, but I
swear that’s what he does because he doesn’t have to read clues…
it’s sickening!  I on the other hand have never found a box
accidentally, in fact I often have NOT found boxes I was looking for
purposefully LOL.  In all seriousness, I’m considering training our
dog to sniff out plastic… hey, if they can teach them to smell explosives
and happy weed, why not plastic ware?</span></p>

You can call me whatever you like, but don't call me late for dinner.<br/>
 That upsets me greatly.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The letter box wasn't hanging out in the middle of nowhere, but my<br/>
husband and I were fishing, and he was looking for a flat place to<br/>
sit.  In the process, he sat down on a semiflat rock, and found what<br/>
he thought was someone's hidden tackle box.  Upon checking it out, he<br/>
realized it was a letter box!  So it's not like the thing jumped up<br/>
and bit him in the butt (wouldn't THAT be a neat trick?!), but we<br/>
didn't know what letter boxing was until we did some research upon<br/>
returning home.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we meet some day on a trail, too!  Do letter boxers have a<br/>
secret sign or something?  Fill me in. <br/>

Of course I know Grant and Dean-- as a matter of fact, Deidre handed<br/>
me Grant's puppy through my classroom window a few months ago, and I<br/>
let her run around my room a little bit!  I've been in contact with<br/>
her, too, not knowing it was her.  I'll have to get in touch with her<br/>
again and tell her who I really am!  So neat!<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on going to your letter box I talked to you about and<br/>
putting in new paper this week.  Should I leave the filled up pad in<br/>
there, or send it to you for keeps?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for inviting me!<br/>

As far as a secret sign, don't worry! All we do when we meet is stamp<br/>
into each other's logbooks with our trail stamps (called an exchange).<br/>
So, when we finally talk you into coming out to Western NY, we'll<br/>
exchange, too!<br/>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>LOL…. Sign yes, secret no LOL  Letterboxers are the
ones who:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>You’ll pass at least twice on the trail. When you pass
them the second time, they will look suspiciously casual as they sit on a rock
in the middle of nowhere and the will either be extra pleasant as they greet
you or instantly turn to the nearest tree and pretend to be: examining a leaf,
tying a shoe or rummaging in the bottom of their knapsack so as to NOT have to greet
you.<br/>
They will sometimes be found standing in a small group in the middle of the
trail muttering to each other and most likely be holding a piece of paper that
looks like it’s been folded and refolded at least thirty times. 
Occasionally you’ll find said paper carefully ensconced in a plastic sheet
protector.<br/>
They may or may NOT be holding a compass but either way chances are they’ll
be turning in circles or venturing slightly off the trail looking under logs
and rocks.  <br/>
If you decide to question them, you may get any number of variety response such
as:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>I’m looking for salamanders….<br/>
I’m part of a group of leprechaun hunters…. ( I actually used this
one once… I don’t even think they noticed)<br/>
I lost a contact…. (Careful with the I “losts”, they might
offer to help)<br/>
I’m really into this hobby where we follow clues around the woods looking
for hidden plastic ware that has a stamp and a notepad in it.  Despite the
ticks and poison ivy and deer flies and heat and chances of twisting an ankle
in the middle of nowhere a bazillion miles from the nearest cell tower.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>You might even be able to tell a letterboxer while shopping in
your favorite X-Mart. If you are online and the person in front of you has in their
cart any combination of:  camo tape, rubber made containers, Ziploc bags,
magic markers, 5 packs of vinyl erasers, inkpads, bug spray, index cards, Strathmore
sketch pads, or golf pencils, chances are they’re a letterboxer.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>I actually met one in Price Chopper when we both went down the aisle
and almost screamed when we saw the Lock N Locks 3x4 containers were on sale
for $1.29.  we both started stacking them in our  carts… it got
faster and faster until we were down to 3… I looked at her and said “Are
you a letterboxer?” and got back one of the biggest grins I’ve ever
got from a total stranger.</span></p>
