This adopted box has a full logbook and a cracked container. The <br/>out-of-state planter didn't care if the box remained in place or not when I <br/>contacted her to adopt it a couple of years ago, so that combined with the <br/>new NY state park geocache permit policy (which may or may not apply to <br/>letterboxes) has led to my decision to retire the box instead of sprucing <br/>it up.<br/><br/>If you'll be in town for the gathering, don't miss it! I highly recommend <br/>parking at the lower lot so that you can fully appreciate the beauty of the <br/>gorge as you hike (parking details are in the clues). Buttermilk Falls is <br/>truly spectacular, so take advantage of this last opportunity to find one <br/>of Central NY's oldest boxes while you still can.<br/><br/>TurtleMcQ<br/><br/>P.S.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So sorry! You may want to consider doing them this weekend while <br/>
you're <br/>
&gt; here for the gathering after all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you're going to be letterboxing a lot, you might want to think <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; making the investment in an Empire Pass. We buy ours first thing <br/>
every <br/>
&gt; spring, and it easily pays for itself over the course of the summer <br/>
&gt; (usually within just a few weeks). I love being able to go hike <br/>
Buttermilk <br/>
&gt; or visit any of our other local state parks without pulling out $7 <br/>
to get <br/>
&gt; in each time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even if I didn't go to state parks as often as I do for the annual <br/>
pass to <br/>
&gt; save us money, I'd consider the $59 our family's thank you to the <br/>
state <br/>
&gt; park system and all the people who keep it running for us. I pull <br/>
it out of <br/>
&gt; the "fun" category in our family budget, and it's some of the best <br/>
money I <br/>
&gt; spend all year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you tell I'm a huge fan of our beautiful state parks and so <br/>
happy to <br/>
&gt; live in close proximity to several? :-)<br/>
