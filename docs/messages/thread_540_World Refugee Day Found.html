<br/>
Hooray!  It's been ages since we were First Finders in the wild!  This <br/>
was a very cool hike.  We were fortunate enough to go on the longest <br/>
day of the year so we could enjoy the scenery.<br/>
<br/>
The box was in a perfect spot, the clues were dead on, and even though <br/>
you knew the box was there it really doesn't look like it's there; it <br/>
should last a long time.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't see any snakes, although the slightest breeze made me jump a <br/>
mile as I was reaching my bare hand under the boulder....<br/>
<br/>
Great surprise in the box, too!  Will be relocating the Goodwill <br/>
Ambassador today in either Rochester or Medina.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Padfoot Treehuggers!<br/>
