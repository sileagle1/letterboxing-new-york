the Student Center) has finally restocked the pink stuff in the handy<br/>
6 x 12 inch size. Although I am a PZ Cut fan, it's nice to know this<br/>
material is available in the area when I am in a pinch. Each of these<br/>
large sheets costs 13.85 and SU employees and staff get a 10%<br/>
discount. Remember, Speedy STAMP = pink stuff = GOOD. Speedy CUT =<br/>
crumbly stuff = BAD.<br/>
<br/>
They also have the small blocks of pink stuff, Speedball handles and<br/>
blades, master carve in both sizes and thicknesses and assorted<br/>
carvable erasers. Also the Moleskin 3 packs of blank logbooks as well<br/>
as the other sizes. Plenty of the 3 x 5 blank sketchbooks/logbooks as<br/>
well as a rather large selection of sketchbooks/journals, both in<br/>
spirals and bound versions. <br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing to do is find a parking spot. I recommend avoiding<br/>
days when SU football/basketball is playing a home game, unless you<br/>
are coming up for the game anyway! The SU Bookstore IS open on<br/>
weekends. Also, there are now 3 boxes planted on campus, and another<br/>
12 within a  mile. And they are NOT all mine! You could make a day of<br/>
it.  :)<br/>
