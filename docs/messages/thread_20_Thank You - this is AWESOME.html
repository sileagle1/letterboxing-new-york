to see so many new members joining!!!<br/>
<br/>
I found LbCNY after I had a very bad experience trying to join <br/>
another regional LB group.  Since joining, I've met so many great <br/>
people.  There aren't a huge amount of letterboxes or letterboxers in <br/>
my immediate corner of NY, but hopefully this group will bring <br/>
us "Upstaters" together, and help promote 'boxing in CNY!!<br/>
<br/>
Also a thank you to the moderators for letting people join that are <br/>
not in our immediate CNY area (which was my issue with the other <br/>
group).  It's great that people from other areas are contributing to <br/>
LB'ing here in NY.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trails sometime ... now off to find another <br/>
box!!!<br/>

It's good to see so much enthusiasm, with people connecting with each other. <br/>
Now, I can picture there being a LbCNY gathering next summer (hopefully, <br/>
while I'm there), so everyone can meet face-to-face, and get dizzy <br/>
exchanging personal stamps!  Now,  I have two regional group affiliations: <br/>
LbCNY, my "vacation back home" group, and LbNCA (Northern California), my <br/>
home base group.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this group should be open to anyone who plants or hunts for <br/>
boxes anywhere in or near Central NY (that would include all of NY, and <br/>
folks who come in from neighboring states). Some of you travel great <br/>
distances to hunt for letterboxes. And everyone has something to share, or <br/>
something to learn. Communities are great, but arbitrary boundaries are <br/>
merely artificial dividers.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I'm now going to invite all of you in this LbCNY group to <br/>
participate in a long distance letterbox series. At some point, many people <br/>
come to San Francisco, either on business or vacation. A while ago, I posted <br/>
an invitation on LbNA, and I'll extend it to this group.<br/>
<br/>
If and when you come to San Francisco, please join our letterbox series: "I <br/>
Left My Heart", and plant a letterbox somewhere here in the city that you <br/>
find is special to you.  You can either call it "I Left My Heart # XX", and <br/>
take the next sequential number in the series listed on letterboxing.org, <br/>
OR, you can do as so0me people have already started. We have "I Left My <br/>
Tarts", "I Lost My Dart", and "I Left My Cart" so far, as a play on words. <br/>
So, if you come to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair, <br/>
and bring a letterbox to plant where you'll leave your heart (or cart or <br/>
tart, or...).       Remember, these are urban letterboxes, and may need some <br/>
camouflaging. There's also the big green and forested Golden Gate Park, <br/>
which is much bigger than Central Park, and home to a number of happy boxes. <br/>
If you need some advice on disguising an urban box, e-mail me. I'm becoming <br/>
an expert quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group, Songchick!<br/>
