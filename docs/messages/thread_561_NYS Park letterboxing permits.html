<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As the one who probably helped prompt this 
conversation with a trip to Letchworth this weekend, I'll jump in.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for what you said, LW, about bringing boxers to 
lesser known parts of areas, little gems, etc. I agree, and think it's a lovely 
idea, and do enjoy it when others do that for me with their boxes. However, it 
does have a downside (at least, for me).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Let me give you an example using this weekend- I 
travelled to Letchworth with my family for a camping weekend. Once there, we 
didnt' leave the park. So, I ended up doing NO letterboxing (other than scouting 
locations int he park for potential boxes), because there were no boxes in the 
park for me to find.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For me, it's hard to just get up and wander around 
towns looking for letterboxes 'near' where I am- in particular, when i'm on 
vacation. This is because I don't have a vehicle to use. So, I appreciate when 
there's boxes in the immediate vicinity of where I am- such as a grand, open, 
and just totally HUGE park like Letchworth.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My feeling about letterboxing has always been along 
the lines of 'oh, neat! There's a letterbox THERE? Cool!' When I first got into 
letterboxing nearly two years ago, I was amazed at all the places that had 
letterboxes already- not only a few places that I frequently visted or at least 
passed by, but also placed I wanted to go, as well. I went to Letchworth four 
years ago, long before I knew about letterboxing. When I found out there were a 
few in the area, and even one that I thought was in the park, I was excited 
about this coming trip.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, that moves me onto the topic of the thread- 
the NYS park permit thing.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was at Letchworth, and I gotta say, it could 
easily be a letterboxing haven. I saw so many great places to hide boxes, and 
many of them I've already begun contimplating the designs for, because 
approximately half of them will be site specific.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Then I came home and hopped on AQ, and after 
drudging through the insane amount of messages and mail I had, was reminded of 
this disappointing permit issue.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However- I am optimistic.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I would be more than willing to cooperate with the 
park on planting letterboxes, even to the point of getting a permit, under the 
condition that it wouldn't be costly, like I know it is in some areas down 
south.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are places where to plant one letterbox in a 
state park, you need to purchase a permit for $30. This permit lasts one year, 
and then must be renewed (with another $30. And then, the permit only covers one 
letterbox- which means if you want to plant more, you have to get ADDITIONAL 
permits.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm sorry, but I just do not have tha tkind of 
money. I already struggle sometimes to find money for the SUPPLIES to make these 
letterboxes. I'm a poor college student! I had to hitch a ride to Syracuse just 
to attend a letterboxing event!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I do admit that I do not know exactly the 
full policy regarding the NYS Park permits- I'll be finding out soon, I hope. 
But I can not afford to cooperate if it involves the kind of money and 
registration that parks down south require.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If the permits WERE to cost money, I would consider 
it as long as it was a one-time fee, and covered multiple box planting. I will 
not get permits for multiple boxes, and I won't be renewing a permit, either (at 
least, not until I have a stable way to pay that!).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">IT is my hope that the permits will be easy to 
obtain, and will not cost money that I dont' have. In addition, if all the park 
employees are asking is to be told and worked with when planting letterboxes, 
then that is easy enough- I know they don't want to lead people into dangerous 
areas, and neither do I.</font></div>

<p><strong>Not sure if any of you saw the following post from Ryan (Atlasquest 
  owner, webmaster and moderator)  on the Atlasquest New York board, but 
  here it is, along with a personal note I received from Ryan and my posted 
  response. Can we have a discussion about this? I would love to hear points of 
  view from others and how they handled their similar  situation. Did you 
  encounter nice Park personnel willing to work with you? Did 
  you design learning  about the location into your 
  stamp/box?  Did you just pull the box or did you ask for a permit? Let's 
  hear from you all out there!</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Post from Ryan on Atlasquest</u>:</strong> Hello, New Yorkers! 
  =) I got this e-mail a few minutes ago from a guy in the New York SP 
  system:<br/><br/><em>"You should be advised that permission is needed via permit 
  from New York State Park Managers in order to place a letter box in a state 
  park. There are rules for geocaches that also apply to letterboxes. (state 
  park management has set spefic rules for placement of such things) Most park 
  managers will work with you in placement of the letterboxes when done so 
  through the park manager. When letterboxes are found without the proper permit 
  they will most likely be removed and the owner notified."</em><br/><br/>I'm not 
  sure if he's refering to a specific box or not, but let it be known, permits 
  are needed if you want to plant a box in a New York SP and they DO know about 
  Atlas Quest so don't think you can sneak around them by posting here instead 
  of LbNA. ;o)<br/></p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Mail from Ryan:</strong></u></p>
<p>I wasn't sure if the ranger from the New York State Parks was e-mailing me 
  about a specific box or not and asked, and this was the 
  reply:<br/><br/>"<em>Ryan,<br/>I apologize for not being specific. There was a 
  box put in the Minna Anthony<br/>Common Nature Center called something like 
  Girls Night Out, I found it, removed itand emailed the owner. Getting 
  permission to put the box in a park is quite easy<br/>the person just has to 
  ask and follow the rules! Thanks for getting back to me.<br/><br/>Randy</em> 
  "<br/><br/>Is that you? =) I can't find a box called "Girls Night Out" on AQ, 
  but I swear I've heard it before and I swear it sounds like something you 
  would do. ;o)<br/><br/>-- Ryan</p>
<p><u><strong>My response on AQ</strong></u></p><font size="2">
<p>Ryan - </p>
<p>Thanks for posting about this. I am not that thrilled about planting in 
  state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those lesser known places that 
  they might not have seen before. Most of my 16 (out of 215!) state park boxes 
  are in lesser known and visited state parks. But having worked with NY State 
  Parks personnel before (I used to work for a prominent 
  architecture/ landscape architecture firm here in NY), I tried to 
  anticipate their concerns and so planted "location" based stamps. You know 
  what I mean... the stamp was about the place and I gave a lot of background 
  about the area and sang it's praises....trying to educate the public. I enjoy 
  finding location stamps myself (so looking at my logbook is sort of like a 
  roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I also love learning about new places and I 
  find that searchers of my boxes are appreciative of that sort of thing as 
  well. In the beginning, I just carved anything that struck my fancy, but now I 
  carve mostly location boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus" box 
  thrown in.</p>
<p>The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have been really cool and 
  happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had my box moved slightly, as 
  they were doing some trail work. When I plant, I make sure I avoid nesting 
  areas and sensitive plants such as fern beds and the like. It's easy to pick 
  up a brochure about the area BEFORE you plant, learn something about the place 
  and then avoid the sensitive spots. I avoid animal holes in trees, placing 
  boxes in ancient rock walls etc. I anticipate the path that might form to the 
  box and so make that path over rocks or pine needles or similar non-sensitive 
  ground cover. I learned from Catbead that under a bridge is a good hiding 
  place for just this reason! All those long hikes with my parents while my 
  mother droned on about plants and their latin names (blah blah blah) must have 
  sunk in a little! lol</p>
<p>After I read your post, I went back through my list and was pleasantly 
  surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10 parks. I think I will take the 
  tactic of contacting each of the park personnel that I haven't spoken to 
  already and let them know about my box, invite them to find it by providing 
  them the clues, and asking them to contact me to pick up the box if they feel 
  it is in an inappropriate area or needs a permit. I've introduced more than a 
  couple of park personnel to letterboxing this way and they seem to enjoy the 
  fact that I lead them RIGHT TO THE BOX, as the majority of my boxes are hidden 
  with families in mind. I encourage all New Yorkers to give letterboxers a good 
  reputation as land and nature stewards by doing the same.</p>
<p>LW</p></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
<p><strong>Although I love the secretive nature of this hobby, I do think that 
  New York State Parks have done a good job of working WITH letterboxers, 
  instead of banning the hobby as other states have done.  Please share 
  your own experiences.</strong></p>

geocachers) as  curious in that the thread seems to<br/>
indicate that NY parks are possibly not very welcoming<br/>
to this type of activity in general.  If they are OK<br/>
with caches then it would seem letterboxes should be<br/>
okay too.  Or perhaps some PR is needed to explain the<br/>
difference between the 2 activities. As far a<br/>
letterboxers being more rogue-ish (sp?) there is one<br/>
park here near Kingston that has removed all the<br/>
caches but allowed the letterboxes to stay!  The park<br/>
superintendent there sees the 2 hobbies as being very<br/>
different and hopes to create 2 distinct policies. <br/>
The caches were too far off the trail, too large and<br/>
the directions to these caches were so vague that<br/>
cachers were ripping up the environs looking for them.<br/>
 He sees letterboxing as a more family type of<br/>
activity and one that can enhance the park experience<br/>
esp when box themes reflect park features.  That's<br/>
what we need to promote!   Nor<br/>

&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have<br/>
&gt; been really cool and happy to let me leave my boxes<br/>
&gt; as is. Only one had my box moved slightly, as they<br/>
&gt; were doing some trail work. When I plant, I make<br/>
&gt; sure I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such<br/>
&gt; as fern beds and the like. It's easy to pick up a<br/>
&gt; brochure about the area BEFORE you plant, learn<br/>
&gt; something about the place and then avoid the<br/>
&gt; sensitive spots. I avoid animal holes in trees,<br/>
&gt; placing boxes in ancient rock walls etc. I<br/>
&gt; anticipate the path that might form to the box and<br/>
&gt; so make that path over rocks or pine needles or<br/>
&gt; similar <br/>

I am not that thrilled about planting in state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those lesser known places that they might not have seen before. Most of my 16 (out of 215!) state park boxes are in lesser known and visited state parks. But having worked with NY State Parks personnel before (I used to work for a prominent architecture/ landscape architecture firm here in NY), I tried to anticipate their concerns and so planted
 "location" based stamps. You know what I mean... the stamp was about the place and I gave a lot of background about the area and sang it's praises....trying to educate the public. I enjoy finding location stamps myself (so looking at my logbook is sort of like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I also love learning about new places and I find that searchers of my boxes are appreciative of that sort of thing as well.

I think I will take the tactic of contacting each of the park personnel that I haven't spoken to already and let them know about my box, invite them to find it by providing them the clues, and asking them to contact me to pick up the box if they feel it is in an inappropriate area or needs a permit. I've introduced more than a couple of park personnel to letterboxing this way

<div>CQ-- There is no fee for these permits. You just have to fill out an 
  application, get a sticker and place in on your cache/letterbox. As part of 
  the application, you have to agree to maintain/visit your cache/letterbox 
  bi-annually. Read over the application, contact the park manager in your 
  region, explain letterboxing if necessary, and take it from there.</div>

<div>Good luck!</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As the one who probably helped prompt this 
      conversation with a trip to Letchworth this weekend, I'll jump 
      in.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for what you said, LW, about bringing 
      boxers to lesser known parts of areas, little gems, etc. I agree, and 
      think it's a lovely idea, and do enjoy it when others do that for me with 
      their boxes. However, it does have a downside (at least, for 
      me).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Let me give you an example using this 
      weekend- I travelled to Letchworth with my family for a camping weekend. 
      Once there, we didnt' leave the park. So, I ended up doing NO letterboxing 
      (other than scouting locations int he park for potential boxes), because 
      there were no boxes in the park for me to find.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For me, it's hard to just get up and wander 
      around towns looking for letterboxes 'near' where I am- in particular, 
      when i'm on vacation. This is because I don't have a vehicle to use. So, I 
      appreciate when there's boxes in the immediate vicinity of where I am- 
      such as a grand, open, and just totally HUGE park like 
      Letchworth.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My feeling about letterboxing has always been 
      along the lines of 'oh, neat! There's a letterbox THERE? Cool!' When I 
      first got into letterboxing nearly two years ago, I was amazed at all the 
      places that had letterboxes already- not only a few places that I 
      frequently visted or at least passed by, but also placed I wanted to go, 
      as well. I went to Letchworth four years ago, long before I knew about 
      letterboxing. When I found out there were a few in the area, and even one 
      that I thought was in the park, I was excited about this coming 
      trip.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, that moves me onto the topic of the 
      thread- the NYS park permit thing.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was at Letchworth, and I gotta say, it 
      could easily be a letterboxing haven. I saw so many great places to hide 
      boxes, and many of them I've already begun contimplating the designs for, 
      because approximately half of them will be site specific.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Then I came home and hopped on AQ, and after 
      drudging through the insane amount of messages and mail I had, was 
      reminded of this disappointing permit issue.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However- I am optimistic.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I would be more than willing to cooperate 
      with the park on planting letterboxes, even to the point of getting a 
      permit, under the condition that it wouldn't be costly, like I know it is 
      in some areas down south.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are places where to plant one letterbox 
      in a state park, you need to purchase a permit for $30. This permit lasts 
      one year, and then must be renewed (with another $30. And then, the permit 
      only covers one letterbox- which means if you want to plant more, you have 
      to get ADDITIONAL permits.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm sorry, but I just do not have tha tkind 
      of money. I already struggle sometimes to find money for the SUPPLIES to 
      make these letterboxes. I'm a poor college student! I had to hitch a ride 
      to Syracuse just to attend a letterboxing event!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I do admit that I do not know 
      exactly the full policy regarding the NYS Park permits- I'll be finding 
      out soon, I hope. But I can not afford to cooperate if it involves the 
      kind of money and registration that parks down south require.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If the permits WERE to cost money, I would 
      consider it as long as it was a one-time fee, and covered multiple box 
      planting. I will not get permits for multiple boxes, and I won't be 
      renewing a permit, either (at least, not until I have a stable way to pay 
      that!).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">IT is my hope that the permits will be easy 
      to obtain, and will not cost money that I dont' have. In addition, if all 
      the park employees are asking is to be told and worked with when planting 
      letterboxes, then that is easy enough- I know they don't want to lead 
      people into dangerous areas, and neither do I.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, I'll probably have more on the subject 
      once I find out exactly what this permit deal entails.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>

      breathe...as well as put on pants, cause he's finally gotten out of 
      bed)</font></div>

<div><strong>Not sure if any of you saw the following post from Ryan 
        (Atlasquest owner, webmaster and moderator)  on the Atlasquest New 
        York board, but here it is, along with a personal note I received from 
        Ryan and my posted response. Can we have a discussion about this? I 
        would love to hear points of view from others and how they handled their 
        similar  situation. Did you encounter nice Park personnel willing 
        to work with you? Did you design learning  about the 
        location into your stamp/box?  Did you just pull the box or did you 
        ask for a permit? Let's hear from you all out there!</strong></div>
<div><strong><u>Post from Ryan on Atlasquest</u>:</strong> Hello, New 
        Yorkers! =) I got this e-mail a few minutes ago from a guy in the New 
        York SP system:<br/><br/><em>"You should be advised that permission is 
        needed via permit from New York State Park Managers in order to place a 
        letter box in a state park. There are rules for geocaches that also 
        apply to letterboxes. (state park management has set spefic rules for 
        placement of such things) Most park managers will work with you in 
        placement of the letterboxes when done so through the park manager. When 
        letterboxes are found without the proper permit they will most likely be 
        removed and the owner notified."</em><br/><br/>I'm not sure if he's 
        refering to a specific box or not, but let it be known, permits are 
        needed if you want to plant a box in a New York SP and they DO know 
        about Atlas Quest so don't think you can sneak around them by posting 
        here instead of LbNA. ;o)<br/></div>
<div><br/><u><strong>Mail from Ryan:</strong></u></div>
<div>I wasn't sure if the ranger from the New York State Parks was 
        e-mailing me about a specific box or not and asked, and this was the 
        reply:<br/><br/>"<em>Ryan,<br/>I apologize for not being specific. There 
        was a box put in the Minna Anthony<br/>Common Nature Center called 
        something like Girls Night Out, I found it, removed itand emailed the 
        owner. Getting permission to put the box in a park is quite easy<br/>the 
        person just has to ask and follow the rules! Thanks for getting back to 
        me.<br/><br/>Randy</em> "<br/><br/>Is that you? =) I can't find a box called 
        "Girls Night Out" on AQ, but I swear I've heard it before and I swear it 
        sounds like something you would do. ;o)<br/><br/>-- Ryan</div>
<div><u><strong>My response on AQ</strong></u></div><font size="2">
<div>Ryan - </div>
<div>Thanks for posting about this. I am not that thrilled about 
        planting in state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those lesser 
        known places that they might not have seen before. Most of my 16 (out of 
        215!) state park boxes are in lesser known and visited state parks. But 
        having worked with NY State Parks personnel before (I used to work for a 
        prominent architecture/ landscape architecture firm here in NY), I 
        tried to anticipate their concerns and so planted "location" based 
        stamps. You know what I mean... the stamp was about the place and I gave 
        a lot of background about the area and sang it's praises....trying to 
        educate the public. I enjoy finding location stamps myself (so looking 
        at my logbook is sort of like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I 
        also love learning about new places and I find that searchers of my 
        boxes are appreciative of that sort of thing as well. In the beginning, 
        I just carved anything that struck my fancy, but now I carve mostly 
        location boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus" box thrown 
        in.</div>
<div>The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have been really cool 
        and happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had my box moved 
        slightly, as they were doing some trail work. When I plant, I make sure 
        I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such as fern beds and the 
        like. It's easy to pick up a brochure about the area BEFORE you plant, 
        learn something about the place and then avoid the sensitive spots. I 
        avoid animal holes in trees, placing boxes in ancient rock walls etc. I 
        anticipate the path that might form to the box and so make that path 
        over rocks or pine needles or similar non-sensitive ground cover. I 
        learned from Catbead that under a bridge is a good hiding place for just 
        this reason! All those long hikes with my parents while my mother droned 
        on about plants and their latin names (blah blah blah) must have sunk in 
        a little! lol</div>
<div>After I read your post, I went back through my list and was 
        pleasantly surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10 parks. I 
        think I will take the tactic of contacting each of the park personnel 
        that I haven't spoken to already and let them know about my box, invite 
        them to find it by providing them the clues, and asking them to contact 
        me to pick up the box if they feel it is in an inappropriate area or 
        needs a permit. I've introduced more than a couple of park personnel to 
        letterboxing this way and they seem to enjoy the fact that I lead them 
        RIGHT TO THE BOX, as the majority of my boxes are hidden with families 
        in mind. I encourage all New Yorkers to give letterboxers a good 
        reputation as land and nature stewards by doing the same.</div>
