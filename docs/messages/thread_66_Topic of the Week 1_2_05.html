camouflaging most of my own boxes just in case they get dragged out. <br/>
I've tried spray paint to diminish the brightness and while that's <br/>
better than nothing, I now sew up a small cammo bag with a fold over <br/>
flap. However the first fabric I used turned out to be better bedding <br/>
for a "crafty mouse" :) than the ripstop nylon I use now.</div>

days!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, we may have to get busy again before long.  We planned to plant <br/>
a series of boxes in Western KY over the holidays but mother nature <br/>
had other plans and did the old switcheroo and sent winter along with <br/>
us.  Sigh.  What could we do?  We went antiquing!  Yay!  Oh, um, I <br/>
mean...sigh.  So now we have a bunch of micro-boxes in my backpack <br/>
feeling sorry for themselves because they didn't get to stay in KY.<br/>
<br/>
Happy 2005!<br/>
