    Hi, I'm working on an article for the Syracuse Post Standard about<br/>
letterboxing and I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm having<br/>
some trouble finding contacts and the like so if you could please get<br/>
back to me that would be wonderful. Thanks so much.<br/>

Well the Post Standard person obviously did some searching through AQ<br/>
as she also contacted me and Plumbean from Liverpool. Plumbean began<br/>
boxing in late May of 2006 but already has over 330 finds!! Anybody<br/>
else receive an email?<br/>
<br/>
I always ask where they heard about it. The New Times fellow was<br/>
introduced to boxing by his friends who are boxers, so I have some<br/>
real hope for that one.<br/>

That opens one of the hot debates here (and on other lists). They are<br/>
generally two camps. One general group would prefer letterboxing<br/>
remain traditionally more secret and be an activity spread by word of<br/>
mouth and so they shun any requests for interviews from any media<br/>
outlet.  There is another general group that feels the hobby has<br/>
already been "outed" and so speaks to the press in order to educate<br/>
new people entering the hobby so that common problems can hopefully be<br/>
avoided. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to the Wonders event, some enthusiastic young boxers spoke to a<br/>
local newspaper and discussed the upcoming Wonders event as part of<br/>
their interview. This caused the local state park manager at the<br/>
hosting site to "panic" about potentially large crowds and so he<br/>
instituted last minute rules (days before the event!!) that used<br/>
Geocaching rules. Geocaching rules included permits, limitations on<br/>
number of boxes (15), limitations on hiding spots (only 10 foot off of<br/>
 trails), minimum distances of 1/4 mile between boxes,  as well as<br/>
upping their event fee. Only quick thinking by the event planners<br/>
avoided a disaster. I am placing NO BLAME on the boxers who were<br/>
interviewed, but only bring this up to show that education is NEEDED.<br/>
Not just for the new boxers, but for park personnel, the media and the<br/>
general public. <br/>
<br/>
We can continue to let these educational opportunities pass by but I<br/>
personally think letterboxing is already OUT there (Silent Doug's<br/>
letterboxing.info site tracks news articles/interviews about<br/>
letterboxing and his site lists 100 already but I know there are<br/>
dozens more that aren't listed). A Time magazine article brought in a<br/>
great many of new boxers a couple of years ago...including many<br/>
"veterans" you read about on various sites and lists. Even Mark Pepe<br/>
didn't start boxing until  mid 2002 and that was after reading an<br/>
article in the Hartford Courant that mentioned letterboxing.  I think<br/>
many would agree that his column has been a nice addition to the<br/>
letterboxing world and yet he and others never would have found<br/>
letterboxing without these news stories. Home School magazines have<br/>
been publishing articles for YEARS about letterboxing..and the home<br/>
schoolers are some of the most active boxers out there.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that WOM is the preferred way to spread letterboxing. But I<br/>
also believe those days are long gone and now just hope to mitigate<br/>
problems by encouraging responsible interviews and urge interviewees<br/>
to ask for proof reading privileges. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this group could come up with a list of topics/points to be<br/>
made in media interviews?<br/>

Here's the lowdown on publicity for me and this instance is a <br/>
perfect example:<br/>
<br/>
No interview + no spilling the beans on the Wonder event = no <br/>
panicked park manager/no scrambling event planners trying to salvage <br/>
the event.<br/>

&gt; That opens one of the hot debates here (and on other lists). They <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; generally two camps. One general group would prefer letterboxing<br/>
&gt; remain traditionally more secret and be an activity spread by word <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; mouth and so they shun any requests for interviews from any media<br/>
&gt; outlet.  There is another general group that feels the hobby has<br/>
&gt; already been "outed" and so speaks to the press in order to educate<br/>
&gt; new people entering the hobby so that common problems can hopefully <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; avoided. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Prior to the Wonders event, some enthusiastic young boxers spoke to <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; local newspaper and discussed the upcoming Wonders event as part of<br/>
&gt; their interview. This caused the local state park manager at the<br/>
&gt; hosting site to "panic" about potentially large crowds and so he<br/>
&gt; instituted last minute rules (days before the event!!) that used<br/>
&gt; Geocaching rules. Geocaching rules included permits, limitations on<br/>
&gt; number of boxes (15), limitations on hiding spots (only 10 foot off <br/>
of<br/>
&gt;  trails), minimum distances of 1/4 mile between boxes,  as well as<br/>
&gt; upping their event fee. Only quick thinking by the event planners<br/>
&gt; avoided a disaster. I am placing NO BLAME on the boxers who were<br/>
&gt; interviewed, but only bring this up to show that education is <br/>
NEEDED.<br/>
&gt; Not just for the new boxers, but for park personnel, the media and <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; general public. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We can continue to let these educational opportunities pass by but I<br/>
&gt; personally think letterboxing is already OUT there (Silent Doug's<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.info site tracks news articles/interviews about<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and his site lists 100 already but I know there are<br/>
&gt; dozens more that aren't listed). A Time magazine article brought in <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; great many of new boxers a couple of years ago...including many<br/>
&gt; "veterans" you read about on various sites and lists. Even Mark Pepe<br/>
&gt; didn't start boxing until  mid 2002 and that was after reading an<br/>
&gt; article in the Hartford Courant that mentioned letterboxing.  I <br/>
think<br/>
&gt; many would agree that his column has been a nice addition to the<br/>
&gt; letterboxing world and yet he and others never would have found<br/>
&gt; letterboxing without these news stories. Home School magazines have<br/>
&gt; been publishing articles for YEARS about letterboxing..and the home<br/>
&gt; schoolers are some of the most active boxers out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree that WOM is the preferred way to spread letterboxing. But I<br/>
&gt; also believe those days are long gone and now just hope to mitigate<br/>
&gt; problems by encouraging responsible interviews and urge interviewees<br/>
&gt; to ask for proof reading privileges. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps this group could come up with a list of topics/points to be<br/>
&gt; made in media interviews?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to think of this re-occurring topic as a 'discussion' rather <br/>
&gt; than a 'debate' :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LW:<br/>
&gt; ****Prior to the Wonders event, some enthusiastic young boxers spoke <br/>
&gt; to a local newspaper and discussed the upcoming Wonders event as <br/>
&gt; part of their interview. This caused the local state park manager at <br/>
&gt; the hosting site to "panic" about potentially large crowds and so he<br/>

&gt; Geocaching rules. Geocaching rules included permits, limitations on<br/>

&gt; of trails), minimum distances of 1/4 mile between boxes, as well as<br/>
&gt; upping their event fee. Only quick thinking by the event planners<br/>
&gt; avoided a disaster.****<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here's the lowdown on publicity for me and this instance is a <br/>
&gt; perfect example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No interview + no spilling the beans on the Wonder event = no <br/>
&gt; panicked park manager/no scrambling event planners trying to salvage <br/>
&gt; the event.<br/>

Blue diamonds, publicity, extreme boxes.....they are all welcomed to be discussed on this forum, rather than debated.</div><div> And as for the skittish park manager, it's because he has obviously dealt with large crowds for geocaching events. There are big misconceptions about letterboxing when it is compared to geocaching. From my recent talks with a few state park managers as well as my
 previous experience as a geocacher...I can tell you that the biggest reasons permits were instituted is because of damage to local fauna and placement of "extreme" caches.  GPS units are accurate up to about 20 feet although some caches are EXACTLY on the coordinates if you can get a strong enough signal (gps units depend on  satellite signals so a heavy tree canopy or extreme cloud cover can affect the signal). That last 20 feet you have to rely on your "geocaching vision"  ....much like our letterboxing vision. But newbie geocachers often trample an area while sweeping over that last 20 foot diameter..while letterboxes tend to take you RIGHT TO THE BOX.</div>Extreme letterboxes ( as determined by AQ's definition) are those which require special skills or equipment in order to retrieve the box, and you are told that up front.  I have gone after numerous caches only to find at the last moment that the cache has been placed over the lip of a cliff or
 along a knife edge. A trinket is not worth the danger, in my own opinion.<br/><br/>So my bottom line is, I guess I am sick and tired of being forced to play by geocaching rules because of a lack of understanding/education about letterboxing. <br/><br/>LW<br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><br/><div><br/></div><br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/><p>
