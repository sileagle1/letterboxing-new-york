any weekend get togethers please post them. I've been writing them <br/>
all down on my calendar and then we're hoping to get to as many as <br/>
we can. Unfortately we can't give definates too far in advance.<br/>
<br/>
  We're looking at putting an addition on our home this summer and <br/>
don't know how much free time we'll have or at what stage of <br/>
building we'll be in.<br/>
<br/>
  We can't wait until the weather gets nicer and we can get back out <br/>
hunting for boxes. Wish there were more in our area in Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
  Which site do you post your new boxes too? Letterboxing.org and/or <br/>
atlasquest ???? <br/>
<br/>
  Since we travel thru there at all kinds of odd hours I've been <br/>
trying to keep printed copies of clues in the RV so depending on the <br/>
time we can just pick a place and stop.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course this means we don't usually add in all the extra time it <br/>
will take with having two small children with us and we usually <br/>
manage to get about 1/2 way thru multi boxes before we run out of <br/>
time or it's too dark to keep hunting. That's ok we'll keep going <br/>
back until we get them all. LOL<br/>
