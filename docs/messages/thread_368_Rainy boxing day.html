Had a very rainy day of boxing Wednesday but it was worth the raindrops -= we looked for seven<br/>
boxes (Syracuse, Dewitt, Manlius and Cazenovia)and found all of them.  We even got a chance to<br/>
plant a box in Cardiff - part of our craft letterbox series. Visited Lock Wenches latest plant in<br/>
Syracuse and was mesmerized by all the oak giants.  A must see for sure. We had quite a laugh at<br/>
one stop where someone has deposited a chair (litter - trash - what ever) right next to the trees<br/>
where the letter box was.  I would have had sat and logged in there if it wasn't so wet. The Gypsy<br/>
