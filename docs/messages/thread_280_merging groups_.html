New York is a ver-r-ry large state, and I wonder if boxers on Long Island will have much interest in the goings-on in Buffalo (for example).<br/>
<br/>
But on a more practical note, it may not be so easy to combine the two discussion forums on Yahoo.  Yahoo is just a shell, and doesn't offer much in the way of tech support.  You may find that you will ahve to start an entirely new group, or re-invite the members of one groupd to join the other.<br/>
<br/>
I support the inclusive urge, but suspect it may prove to be a bit of a pain to institute.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-429272707">I thought about this, too and came to the conclusion that really, all <br/>
we're doing is merging in name. All the other aspects of New York <br/>
letterboxing have already been merged (well already go to each <br/>
other's regions and box/gather), so all that really was left was to <br/>
merge boards. I figured since I put the idea out there, I probably <br/>
was the one who needed to make the name switch. On a tech note, I <br/>
figured rather than make a bunch of people rejoin a whole new group, <br/>
I'd just change LBWNY and let the few who aren't already signed up <br/>
click and join.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I hope no one feels like they HAVE to join the LBNY group. It <br/>
looked like a lot of you wanted to have just one board to deal with, <br/>
so I made one. For people that don't, no change is necessary. If it <br/>
turns out this doesn't work the way I'd hoped, then I can just <br/>
reinstate LBWNY in a couple of keystrokes (good thing it's summer!) I <br/>
know I'm still a part of LBNE, LBGLK and LBMA just so I can see <br/>
what's going on within a day's drive, so if people choose keep an <br/>
LBCNY membership and the LBNY one, it won't affect anything.<br/>
