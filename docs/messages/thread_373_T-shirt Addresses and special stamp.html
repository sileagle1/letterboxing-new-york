CLEANING (grumble) and have no idea where the addresses are for those <br/>
of you who wanted your shirts mailed. So, if you paid the extra $3.95 <br/>
to have us mail out your shirts, please contact us offlist with your <br/>
address. Off hand, I know Tamsyn and June &amp; Joy wanted theirs mailed. <br/>
Missmoon, I thought you did , too, but don't recall.<br/>
