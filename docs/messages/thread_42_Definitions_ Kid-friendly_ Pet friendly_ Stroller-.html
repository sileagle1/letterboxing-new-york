about dogs, strollers or handicap access, but that's easy enough to<br/>
mention.  When I first started writing clues I used this as my guide.<br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/</a> <br/>
Personally I prefer everything spelled out in more detail rather than<br/>
the compact number system (Difficulty rating 1, Terrain rating 2.5),<br/>
because I usually end up explaining it and adding more stuff to it<br/>
anyway.      <br/>

</span></blockquote>Kid-friendly usually means under 2 miles in round-trip length (though<br/>
people with really young kids would probably say under 1 mile), fairly<br/>
level terrain and free of hazards such as steep cliffs at trailside,<br/>
water crossings or boulder hopping. You might try looking at the<br/>
trails from a parent's viewpoint when you plant the boxes and see if<br/>
there are any elements that would make them concerned about their<br/>
little ones' safety when you're deciding if a particular box is<br/>
kid-friendly or not.<br/>
<br/>
Pet-friendly usually means a location where pets are allowed. Include<br/>
information about any leash restrictions, if you can find that out.<br/>
<br/>
Stroller-friendly usually means a paved path with relatively little<br/>
elevation change, something a regular (not jogging) stroller could be<br/>
pushed along without much difficulty. Stroller-friendly often<br/>
translates to wheelchair-friendly, which can be helpful for some to<br/>
know as well. If you do use the "wheelchair-friendly" designation,<br/>
just be sure to note in the clues if the box itself is off the main<br/>
path and not accessible to someone in a wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
It's very sweet of you to think of including this information,<br/>
especially for people who like to box with their families and/or pets.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
