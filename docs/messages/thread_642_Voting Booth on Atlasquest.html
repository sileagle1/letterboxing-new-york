</span></blockquote>Lock Wench's post was referring to something different altogether. Ryan <br/>
recently set up polls to let AQ members vote on two sets of features. These <br/>
are the poll questions:<br/>
<br/>
When you view a letterbox's details, how much information would you like to <br/>
see about the finds and attempted finds for that box?<br/>
1. Show all previous finds and attempts (the way it is now)<br/>
2. The owner of the box should decide<br/>
3. Don't display it at all (like it used to be)<br/>
4. No preference<br/>
<br/>
Blue diamonds­keep 'em or trash 'em?<br/>
1. I love blue diamonds! Keep 'em!<br/>
2. I hate blue diamonds! Trash 'em!<br/>
3. No preference<br/>
<br/>
If you have opinions about either one, simply log into AQ and then choose <br/>
"voting booth" under the My Page tab to vote.<br/>
<br/>
And then go out to find some boxes - I can't believe this weather!!!<br/>
