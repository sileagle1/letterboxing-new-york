week ... busy time of year here and haven't been able<br/>
to get online much<br/>
<br/>
My trail name was actually given to me by one of my<br/>
students.  Quite a few years back, one of the little<br/>
darlings told me "for a teacher, you're a pretty cool<br/>
chick". Then another one piped up "yep, a SONG<br/>
CHICK!!"  Considering the fact that I'm a music<br/>
teacher, I thought it was perfect.  And it stuck.<br/>
<br/>
I get the names for my boxes based on what happens to<br/>
be going on in my life at the time.  It can be<br/>
anything from wishing that it would snow (hence the<br/>
"NY - a Winter Wonderland" series), or having my<br/>
wisdom teeth out (The Educated Molars PLB).  Sometimes<br/>
I use a combination of events and locations.  My<br/>
"B.U.tterfly" box was done after the Painted Lady<br/>
butterflies in my daughter's class hatched, but it's<br/>
also located on the Binghamton University nature trail<br/>
(B.U.)<br/>
<br/>
Here's wishing everyone a very happy holiday season!<br/>

<br/>
We have named our boxes a couple different ways.  Some I carved first <br/>
because I liked the picture (Oak of 1812 and Braddock Duck), some we <br/>
planned out thoroughly before carving (NYS Thruway Series), some we <br/>
wanted to do just because we liked the area (Little Ruth's), and of <br/>
course, the Toxin Series is my "Social Consciousness" contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Some favorite names we came up with are "Still Standing", "Fuchsia <br/>
Fish", and "Amanda's Gold".  Those ones were fun and <br/>
special.  "Kelsey's Chicken" I carved for one of our young Onions.  I <br/>
gave it to her for her birthday and she placed it where she wanted it <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the real reason I'm posting is to say<br/>
*Merry Christmas* !!<br/>
and Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>
Coming in 2005:  2 new Toxins:  "SARS" (a hitchhiker) and "Lewiston <br/>
Half-life".  Stay tuned.......<br/>

Highlander's a duck hunter), but then we go with favorite things or <br/>
special areas, too. Most of our Lockport boxes have to do with <br/>
Lockport history or my school's group, PACE. It's usually the place <br/>
that defines the stamp, but in the case of the gathering, it was the <br/>
theme and in the case of Homestar, one of our recent stamps...well, <br/>
we just like Homestar! :-) <br/>
