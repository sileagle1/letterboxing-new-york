<div>This weekend was great.  Boxing Thursday, Saturday, and today! Woo hoo!  Anyone else get some boxes in this awfully hot weather?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thursday the dogs and I drove to Syracuse and did "Straight Through to China", "Wonders of Onondaga Park", and "My Favorite Irish Things." On one of the searches we came across a very big and very dead Norway Rat. Ewww! (Not in the letterbox by the way, LOL!). Lucy and Clifford, my ex-racing greyhounds, were very excited upon the find! Gross! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Saturday, my pal "Spudhund" (who got me addicted to letterboxing!) and I went out and did Taphophiles Unite (both St. Agnes and Oakwood), Your Ad Here, Work Drones (I got my first first-finders certificate, yeah!), Kaneeda, Just Passing Through NY, and Cairn.  Too hot for us to bring the greyhounds (my guys and her boy, Bailey) so we dragged her husband along, instead. He was a great navigator! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today Spudhund and I (and her hubby and the dogs) were up in northern Cayuga County for our greyhound walking club meet. We did the 5 Sterling Nature Center boxes... very cool! We then did our group walk with the club, and Spudhund, hubby, and some other greyhound people (potential converts, LOL!) went to do Three Mice and a Cat series of boxes. Unfortunately my girl Lucy, who will be 9 soon, was too whooped so we couldn't join them. Next time!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This afternoon, in front of the luscious fans, I am finishing up "Lucy and Clifford's Wildlife Adventure" series and we will be planting them tomorrow at the Cayuga Community College Nature Trail in Auburn. There are 9 stamps in this series. :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope everyone is keeping cool!</div>

This heat has pretty much kept me house bound this<br/>
weekend.  But I did print an entire 3-ring binder full<br/>
of clues in areas that are within a couple hours drive<br/>
of home so Soccerchick and I can start doing road<br/>
trips!!!  I also plan on working on some stamps to<br/>
plant in the Binghamton area, so the heat is giving me<br/>
the chance to catch up on my stamp carving!<br/>

<div>Well, we didn't think it was legal. ;-) Like most urban parks
these days, it's better to be there in the daytime than not, and by
the time we encountered these characters it was getting late.  It
happens.</div>
