with whatever decision is made, as long as it benefits letterboxing <br/>
throughout the state. I'm just happy that so much more is happening <br/>
throughout NY than there was 1 year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue that's related is how letterboxing.org slices the state. <br/>
That map made no sense to me at all. In the Utica-Rome area, we <br/>
probably relate more to Sytacuse (and the Western NY section of their <br/>
map) than the north. In order to pick boxes to hunt for, you have to <br/>
check 3 sections of letterboxing.org's map in CNY.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, the Thruway unites a big share of the state.<br/>

always be people who live near a boundary (state, country, whatever) <br/>
who will have to check several different sections in order to find <br/>
all the stuff that's near them.<br/>
<br/>
But if people who live in a state want to redivide the state, the <br/>
webmasters of the site have been accommodating, so inquire, <br/>
particularly if you have the web skills necessary to facilitate the changes.<br/>

I agree!  This is also very irritating in the Albany area, which <br/>
basically comprises the counties of Albany, Schenectady, Saratoga, and<br/>
Rensselaer.  The first is actually listed as part of SouthEastern NY, <br/>
the rest as North. Montgomery and Schoharie aren't far away either...<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we can convince the webmasters to redraw the regions so <br/>
they make sense to the residents?<br/>
