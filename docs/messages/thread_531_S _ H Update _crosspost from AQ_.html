of encouragement that I thought I should update you all on how we're <br/>
doing. A few months ago, we were being told that our first pregnancy <br/>
(after trying for 5+ years) wasn't working out and that we'd have to <br/>
scrap everything and start over. Needless to say, it was a rough <br/>
time, complicated by work troubles for both the Highlander and I (him <br/>
missing work days because of the two herniated discs &amp; stanosis in <br/>
his neck and me just not enjoying my work the way I used to). Money <br/>
was tight and our situation looked like a Dickens novel for a while <br/>
(full of misery, woe and longwinded explanations!).<br/>
<br/>
However, things have improved considerably. We left our fertility <br/>
specialist Dr. Sperazza (who was a evil sprite-wing plucking <br/>
brownie/troll),  then had a successful and very easy D &amp; C procedure <br/>
to start all over again. We tried to go to another doctor, only to <br/>
find out that he was retiring. That would have been enough to sink <br/>
the ship if his nurse hadn't heard our story and told us we were one <br/>
of MANY couples that had left Dr. Evil...er, Sperazza. She gave us <br/>
the number of a wonderful nurse practicioner in our area who's taken <br/>
us in without any delay. We'll start the process over again within <br/>
the next few weeks! <br/>
<br/>
Kevin (the Highlander) will FINALLY get to see a neurosurgeon about <br/>
his neck at the end of this month, but the crippling pain he was <br/>
having earlier seems to have gotten better after doing some of the <br/>
physical therapy they recommended...in fact, I seem to have pulled <br/>
his neck back into at least a tolerable position during one session, <br/>
so he's been able to take less heavy meds and go to work.<br/>
<br/>
School's almost out and I'll be returning to a regular classroom in <br/>
the fall, so my world will go back to its normal 4th grade <br/>
predictability again.  But, as Dorothy says "If I ever go looking for <br/>
my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back <br/>
yard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin <br/>
with!" <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again to all of you who sent us kind words, gifts and <br/>
other support to help us through the rough patch. The sun is peeking <br/>
out again and we're seeing light at the end of the tunnel because of <br/>
wonderful folks like you to lean on! We hope to see all of you in <br/>
Ithaca, but DEFINITELY want to see you at our own event at Darien <br/>
Lakes!<br/>

such kindhearted people) Sprite &amp; Highlander</div>
