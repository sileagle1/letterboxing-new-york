                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-808931451">Yesterday was an odd one.  I went looking for Cock O the trails ECS box <br/>
listed on LbNA in Seneca Falls totally skipping over the section of the <br/>
clue that told me it was missing. Oddly enough I found a box that was <br/>
according to the log book planted by Rabbit Hutch on 7/17/05.  I can't <br/>
find the box or the boxer on either AQ or LbNA.  Has anybody heard of <br/>
this box or boxer.  I have contacted Cock o the trail to see if it his <br/>
box replanted.  Otherwise I have found an abandoned box, or maybe it <br/>
just appeared.  Spooky.  Yet another reason to always keep your kit in <br/>
your car u never know when or where a box might appear.<br/>
