                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-543263607">Here is my history behind this patch endeavor. The LbNA group got way <br/>
too many posts that had nothing to do with the eastern part of NY <br/>
state. So I went to the LbNE group which worked out fine. Then in the <br/>
mean time the western New York group was formed and I was <br/>
like "YES!!!" At this point in time I decided that I would not begin <br/>
an eastern group because I did not believe there were enough boxers <br/>
interested. Also, I did not wish to split the state. Then I thought <br/>
the western NY group would eventually realize they would have to <br/>
become a state (discovering the boxers from central NY) I did not in <br/>
any of these cases decide to become a mediator of eastern or NY group <br/>
because in summer I do not have access to a computer (although that <br/>
will be changing this summer). <br/>
<br/>
Although I knew the t-shirt design existed when I posted the patch <br/>
idea, I thought it was from a gather that I had attended not a logo <br/>
which represented the old western site.<br/>
<br/>
I may be ruffling peoples' feathers here but I think the patch design <br/>
idea should be given a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Though this is more then .02 worth, I firmly believe that newer <br/>
people of the NY state group should be allowed to have a say <br/>
in designing a patch/logo. <br/>
<br/>
If Sprite's gets voted so be it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW As of this date, I have no design to submit (though I may submit <br/>
one if time allows for me to draw one out).<br/>
<br/>
I had tried to keep quiet about the postings but finally felt it <br/>
necessary to speak up as so many others felt it necessary to give an <br/>
opinion instead of just voting and let the vote speak for itself.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-240942768">I understand what you're saying. You're saying you want to make sure <br/>
people get equal say in this logo, which makes plenty of sense. <br/>
However, if that's the case, then what you've said here and on your <br/>
poll is a little contradictory. You're saying we should have a say, <br/>
but then you're saying we shouldn't discuss this, we should just <br/>
vote. You also only put a vote out on the table, but then didn't make <br/>
it clear what we were really voting on. I personally voted yes at <br/>
first because I thought you were asking should the group have a patch <br/>
with maybe some other kind of design, just for the sake of having a <br/>
nifty patch. Once I (and apparently other people) realized the idea <br/>
was to change the logo we'd all previously voted on for LbNY, that's <br/>
when I think a lot of folks got upset. It was, however unintentional, <br/>
rather misleading.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of just voting without knowing all the the facts seems a <br/>
little strange, too. In no way did you mention that we already HAVE a <br/>
logo that we voted on some time ago, even though my post way back <br/>
when stated that changing the logo to reflect our whole state was <br/>
exactly what I had in mind. To force a vote on the same topic to try <br/>
to get a different outcome is to disregard what we as a group had <br/>
already said we wanted (almost like yelling "do over!" in the middle <br/>
of a game). That's just not the democratic way. Even in congress, no <br/>
one just brings up a vote and says, "okay GO!" The merits of the <br/>
previous discussions on that topic are discussed to decide if a vote <br/>
is even necessary and if the consensus is that there's no need to <br/>
change what's already been established, then no time is wasted on a <br/>
revote.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to say that newbies need a chance to voice their opinion is <br/>
prefectly fine, except for two things. First, when you muddle the <br/>
facts (not mentioning the original logo, saying we're voting on a <br/>
patch, not a logo), and you close off discussion about the facts ("to <br/>
give an opinion instead of just voting and let the vote speak for <br/>
itself") you don't give them a clear understanding of what they're <br/>
voting for, so you're not really getting a real vote. It's almost <br/>
like people in Buffalo voting for a Canadian president; sure, we live <br/>
nearby, but we have only a basic understanding of Canadian life and <br/>
politics (most of which is skewed by varying opinions). Second, <br/>
anytime you join a group, that group doesn't turn around and revote <br/>
on their established symbols and I don't think anyone who joins a <br/>
group would find that odd. Millions of people come to the US every <br/>
day, but we've kept the flag, the eagle and the national anthem for <br/>
over 200 years. If we as a group had to revote every time we had a <br/>
dozen new members, at some point, even today's newbies would feel <br/>
slighted in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you're asking should we come up with some NEW symbols to add <br/>
to the ones we have (like do we add a magnetic ribbon to go with the <br/>
flag and do we create OTHER songs about America) then sure! And if <br/>
Lock Wench still wants to commemorate her gathering with something, <br/>
I'm all for buying something like that, too. But all this needs to be <br/>
made clear and needs to be discussed before being brought to the <br/>
table instead being forced on a very misinformed and/or biased public.<br/>
<br/>
So, just to clarify, let's start over. Let's make sure everyone <br/>
understands first that we do already have a logo that was voted on so <br/>
that there's no confusion. Also, when I say logo, I mean a design <br/>
that the whole group uses to represent itself in public, so I'm using <br/>
the two interchangeably. I created the logo on the back of the t-<br/>
shirt with that in mind when people felt like the two groups should <br/>
merge. <br/>
<br/>
Then I'd ask this: What are you (Phynstar) specifically looking for <br/>
as an outcome to this patch question? First, are you trying to ask do <br/>
we want a patch or not or are you looking to replace the logo? If <br/>
it's about the patch, are you wanting to A) make a patch with any <br/>
kind of design to add to our set of LBNY stuff?, B) make a patch with <br/>
our current logo already on it. If it's about replacing the logo, <br/>
then we should ALL get to talk about the merits of doing so before <br/>
you ask us to vote so that everyone's got the same understanding and <br/>
can make up their mind in an educated way. <br/>
