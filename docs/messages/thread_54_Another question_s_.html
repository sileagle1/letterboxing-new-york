Did I miss something when I was reading about letterboxes and having <br/>
crazy fun names? I love all the names we come across and the stamps <br/>
that go with them.<br/>
  How did you decide what name to use for a name and a stamp? Do you <br/>
have mini versions of your stamps for microboxes or are your stamps <br/>
small enough to do both anyways? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Answers: Our first stamp was a set of baby footprints in purple <br/>
and signed by the Duca family. We were on vacation when we found our <br/>
first 5 boxes and went with what we could find. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      When we went to create a stamp we ended up using the letters <br/>
in our last name in an overlaying combination which we kinda like. <br/>
But we made it too big so now we're working on making a separate <br/>
smaller stamp for microboxes.<br/>
