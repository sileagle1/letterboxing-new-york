Ryan is exactly correct. The problem was the database searches.  <br/>
Bandwidth and storage were not the issue. We'll need to upgrade to a  <br/>
higher level of service that can give us the database horsepower that  <br/>
we need as we continue to grow.<br/>

   Subject: [LbNA] Re: LbNA offline<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I have a suggestion to save bandwidth, remove the scroll graphic<br/>
&gt; and any other non-essential graphics from the webpages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   I'm not really sure what resources the letterboxing.org website went<br/>
   over, but based on my experience with Atlas Quest, there's a lot more<br/>
   at issue than just bandwidth. For me, running the queries that  <br/>
perform<br/>
   the searches or look up message board posts and such take up far more<br/>
   of their share of processing power, and I've been considering<br/>
   upgrading my account. For the bandwidth itself, AQ uses less than 10%<br/>
   of what's allotted to it.<br/>
<br/>
   Assuming LbNA is suffering from similar problems, it's not likely the<br/>
   site is suffering from bandwidth issues but rather processing  <br/>
power to<br/>
   run the queries. </span></blockquote></div>
