the boxes this weekend for the event (since I'm booked for just about<br/>
every other weekend after that). If I'm able to do so, I'll be posting<br/>
the clues to the boxes EARLY (yes, early!) so those of you who can't<br/>
spend THAT day getting stamps could get all the main stamps, then just<br/>
stop by our place for the event stamp, some camaraderie and some basic<br/>
Halloween fare (candy, apples, candy, doughnuts, candy,<br/>
coffee...um...candy?)<br/>
<br/>
I intend to have 30 total Orleans County cemeteries in the tour (which<br/>
isn't even all the places we COULD go) and all the stamps will be<br/>
drivebys. There might be SOME walking uphill, but nothing to get too<br/>
worked up about if you've got decent knees. I'll have a better<br/>
estimate of the time and mileage involved, but I would say allot a<br/>
good 3 hours (especially if you want to buy pies and pumpkins and such<br/>
while you're out and about).<br/>
<br/>
More bulletins as warranted!<br/>

Again, if you want to make a test run, let us know how it goes so we<br/>
can make corrections if need be. Don't try to banzai the whole tour in<br/>
one day if you can help it (or start early and take a break as<br/>
needed!). The first leg took about 3 hours, for sure, but we don't<br/>
quite know about the second. The Highlander got some kind of 24 hour<br/>
bug while we were out (on that note, Otter Creek has a nice spot in<br/>
the WAYYYY back if anyone wants to play Guess What the Highlander Ate<br/>
for Sunday Breakfast!), so we had to do the last part over two days<br/>
and forgot to watch the time. We also mixed up two of the stamps<br/>
because I grabbed the wrong one in my hurry to get him home, but I<br/>
mentioned the mistake in the clues so you'll know.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, be sure to let us know if you go and we'll give you<br/>
our home number in case you get lost. I uploaded the map to a page as<br/>
well, but if you want a better view, get a Western Region map from<br/>
Mapworks...it's the best!<br/>
<br/>
No more updates unless something's changed, so we'll see all of you on<br/>
the 20th!<br/>
