<br/>
I had sooooo much fun at this gathering. A big thank you to Paul in <br/>
SF and his extended family and friends. We felt so welcome and at <br/>
home....and the boxes were AWESOME.  I loved finding Splash right <br/>
after I got there!! And then the CNY 1st Anniversary Event <br/>
stamp......you guys are soooo clever with your clues. Of course, how <br/>
was I supposed to know that so many fairies lived in that garden?!? <br/>
But my alltime favorite box was the -------, Baker and Candlestick <br/>
Maker. Thank goodness I got a hint on one of the clues or I would <br/>
still be there today!! LOL    <br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting you all and putting faces with the stamps I see. <br/>
Thank you for giving me advice on improving the Leprechaun Series. I <br/>
am glad you all were the FF's. I will have to wait for my order of <br/>
new leprechaun boxes to come....but then I will be out there <br/>
replanting the lost ones. And thank you for planting a box to keep my <br/>
Moss Island box company. It's a cool place to go and spend a day....I <br/>
love exploring all of it.<br/>
<br/>
I especially want to thank my traveling companions...catbead, <br/>
LisaScenic and MTNest Robin. It was a lot of fun traveling <br/>
together....now let's see if catbead is still talking to me after my <br/>
navigating! lol<br/>
<br/>
And to Paul...thank you for starting this group and for inspiring me <br/>
to make new boxes. I will be working hard to make your next visit to <br/>
CNY a fun one. In the meantime, can I borrow your family and <br/>
neighbors? They ROCK.<br/>
