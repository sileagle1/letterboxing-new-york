find that bird.  Not his usual clever technique.  The first time I was on the look out for the<br/>
local police because it was getting close to gate closing time. <br/>

Wish I could have joined you Lock wench at the Alpine group.  I was so pleased to see that Bill had<br/>
taken over for Barbara and it would have been nice to hear him speak. <br/>
<br/>
well, back to making pies<br/>

boxes. I happily printed out all the new clues and then was stopped <br/>
dead with a bitter cold weekend. I barely managed to plant a pile of <br/>
Herkimer County boxes I had laying around for months. It was sooo cold <br/>
when I went out, my planned short hikes became drive-bys! The next day <br/>
I woke up to go FIND boxes and quickly decided it was too bitter. Now <br/>
today I have some time and it's currently very dark and pouring rain <br/>
outside. *sigh*  <br/>
<br/>
In other news, I am sorry to hear about the lost box. It's frustrating, <br/>
I know. Especially when you have put a lot of work into one.  Recheck <br/>
to make sure you can't improve your placement (the majority of my lost <br/>
boxes was due to my own poor planning) and try again. And cross your <br/>
fingers!<br/>
<br/>
A quick shout out to Craftymouse for the new nephew...congrats!<br/>
<br/>
And a quick update on Desperately Seeking Sun/Suds. I have posted the <br/>
raffle prizes and other new info on the event site. Anyone who needs <br/>
more info, let me know. And could y'all start doing a snow dance? Don't <br/>
get me wrong, I am grateful for the balmy temperatures as I don't feel <br/>
like handing Nimo, National Grid, whatever, my ENTIRE paycheck....but I <br/>
definately would like some snow in mid February. Yeah...just keep it <br/>
warm until after Valentine's Day so I have time to plant boxes in nice <br/>
weather and then send me a huge blizzard for a couple of days and then <br/>
bring out the Desperately Sought Sun. That would be PERFECT.<br/>
