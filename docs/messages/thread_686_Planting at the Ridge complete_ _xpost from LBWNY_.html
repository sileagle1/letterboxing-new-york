everything we had (all 33 of ours, 14 of his and the 4 donations we<br/>
received. We are "TO' up from the FLO' up", as my granny used to say<br/>
(which meant "worn out" for you traditional Northerners!) but ready to<br/>
go boxwise. I have a few more stamps to carve for the night event (and<br/>
some prize stamps for various things at the event), but other than<br/>
that, WNY is open for business!<br/>
<br/>
The clues for the boxes planted today will officially be posted on the<br/>
website by Thursday morning. However, if you are coming from out of<br/>
state and leaving Thursday night before the clues are posted, have no<br/>
fear! The exact info in on the page will be in the clue books at the<br/>
park and out of town guests AUTOMATICALLY get one, so long as you come<br/>
to the park for it. If you want to start early, the boxes that are<br/>
already in the park have been posted on the site already...just print<br/>
them off and you'll be all set! DO NOT use the clues that are<br/>
currently (as of Sunday) posted, though...they've already confused one<br/>
person, so Chadams is trying to rewrite them and they SHOULD be good<br/>
by Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
More bulletins as warranted!<br/>
