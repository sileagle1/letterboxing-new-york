check on our series. We'd received word yesterday that a couple of <br/>
our boxes had been vandalized by -of all people- geocachers! The <br/>
first one that was struck was easily repaired and should be alright <br/>
in it's current location. Kaisa's box (#3 in the series) has been <br/>
removed. We need to replace it in a different location, and we'll do <br/>
so in the near future. What the geocachers wrote and drew into <br/>
Kaisa's logbook was completely OBSCENE and I'm just thankful that no <br/>
families had attempted to find it. We owe a BIG thank you to <br/>
Trailhoundz for letting us know what had happened to our boxes! We <br/>
knew that geocachers had found Kaisa's box in the past, but this was <br/>
ridiculous! We'll post again when we hide this box in a new location. <br/>
Grrrrr......<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Trailhoundz has an awesome signature stamp!!!! Dandelion and I <br/>
both loved it.<br/>

On behalf of all geocachers, I apologize.  Most geocachers, (we are <br/>
also geocachers) are pretty nice.  Most have no interest in <br/>
letterboxing (not high tech enough), but they wouldn't think of <br/>
bothering a letterbox if they ran into one.  I am so disappointed and I <br/>
will try to get the word out on local forums to respect letterboxes.  <br/>
If I ever see a letterbox near a geocache I let the placer who got <br/>
there second know so that they can consider moving the box or cache to <br/>
another spot.  Scout (Miller family)</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-439298847">Thanks everyone for all the kind thoughts and words about the <br/>
geocaching incident. I'm done being miffed about it and we'll just <br/>
move it to a new location. We took a vacation to Kingston Ontario this <br/>
weekend and did some serious letterboxing! (Finding tons of boxes <br/>
ALWAYS cheers you up, right?!) We had a great time and highly <br/>
recommend the Kingston area boxes! All very well done and mostly quick <br/>
and easy finds. Lots of fun historic places too. (Norasta, you guys <br/>
are GOOD!) <br/>
<br/>
Now all I can think about is what I'm going to carve for the WNY <br/>
gathering! So many ideas.....  We hope to see you all there!<br/>
<br/>
Man, I think I left my brain in Canada. It's really hard to sit here <br/>
at my desk at work when I know there are more boxes out there to find <br/>
on such a nice day!<br/>
