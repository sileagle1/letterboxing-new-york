<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>
<br/>
While Christmas shopping last night, I was in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and came<br/>
across Snap 'n Lock boxes.  They are very similar to Lock &amp; Lock boxes.<br/>
<br/>
There were 2 sizes that I bought:<br/>
<br/>
2 cups for $2.99<br/>
Inside size L5" x W3" x D1.75"<br/>
<br/>
4.5 cups for $4.99<br/>
Inside size L7" x W4.75 x D1.75"<br/>
<br/>
The sides slope up from the bottom so that the inside Lengths &amp; Widths at<br/>
the top are a bit larger than the sizes I listed above. There were other<br/>
sizes but I think those 2 were the best (for me anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The parent company is Snapware and the website is www.snapware.com.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the Lock &amp; Lock boxes are better but these are a very good<br/>
alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else tried these boxes?<br/>
