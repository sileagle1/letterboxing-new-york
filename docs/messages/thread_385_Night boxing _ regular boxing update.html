this year...but maybe next Halloween! Sorry, folks!<br/>
<br/>
Still, we (okay, I...the Highlander was up duck hunting at 3am!) had a <br/>
good day boxing today. Tirolbill, the IAP and I picked up the rest of <br/>
the boxes in North Tonawanda and a bunch of the Kenmore kids' Plumber's <br/>
Tools series. We also dropped off everyone's gifts to Team Dakota and <br/>
hooked up with a new boxing group at Cup of Joe, We Who Must Not Be <br/>
Named! Hopefully we'll get them to show up at a gathering next year! <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else do any boxing today?<br/>

Alas, even with this WONDERFUL weather, it was not to be. I spent <br/>
Friday night in the Emergency Room with my vomiting 16 year old son. <br/>
He will be fine but needs to undergo surgery..which I am trying to <br/>
get scheduled for just before the Veteran's Day long weekend so he <br/>
won't miss much school. Dragged myself into my second job (working at <br/>
the Carrier Dome box office) and had a meeting with security..who are <br/>
trying to track down my "Loud House" box that went missing recently. <br/>
They were surprisingly cool about learning that I had hidden a box in <br/>
the Dome! Recent construction at the Dome is probably the culprit so <br/>
they are checking with the grounds and maintainence crews...  <br/>
Meanwhile, I got to spend some time with Coach Mac, which is always <br/>
fun. Has anyone ever enjoyed their retirement as much as him? I doubt <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Last night was spent building Halloween displays (our family is <br/>
MAJORLY into Halloween...what with a comic book artist father, a film <br/>
festival administration mother, a travel writer daughter, a <br/>
photographer daughter and a film directing son). I crashed early and <br/>
was grateful for the extra hour of DST sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I was asked to go boxing today, but with a film fest website in need <br/>
of updating, 6" of leaves on the ground, clogged gutters and a porch <br/>
roof badly in need of tarring...I really couldn't. I coded and wrote, <br/>
raked and bagged, scraped and brushed..and am now just taking a break <br/>
before the tarring begins. *sigh*  But I must admit it's fun to get <br/>
all the mail from people finding my boxes...and makes my maintenance <br/>
duties easier. Spud Hund has been especially busy...<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and Happy Halloween, all! (don't forget to visit my Glow-in-<br/>
the-Dark box "The Haunting" or one of my many cemetary <br/>
boxes "Taphophiles, Unite!" series)<br/>
