                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1758822799">I got a report this weekend.  Apparently someone decided it was<br/>
appropriate to look for "Every Day is Earth Day" on Earth Day.  The<br/>
box is fine, but the grounds crew still hasn't put out the golf<br/>
markers, so they had to walk the entire golf course to find the box!<br/>
<br/>
Also, "Little Bluebird" still hasn't been found by anyone yet.  I'm<br/>
busy with Grad School right now, but if she still hasn't been found in<br/>
the next two weeks, I'll add a First Finders card to her as an incentive.<br/>
<br/>
Recently checked on "Buffalo Wings"  Alive and well.  I swear half of<br/>
the entries are marked "My first letterbox!". :D :D :D<br/>
