Subject: [SPAM] [LbNY] Pulled Boxes - Keep on Tri-ing<br/>
<br/>
The "Keep on Tri-ing" letterboxes planted at Green Lakes State Park are pulled for near future.  My website, AQ and LBNA will all be updated with this status.  They will be re-planted next spring.  Thanks to everyone that found these boxes and re-hid them great - I had to look really hard for one of them! <br/>
