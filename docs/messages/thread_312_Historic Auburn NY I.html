Jen Z but wanted to post here in case anyone was going after this 3 <br/>
box series anytime soon...  when we found box #2, the open tupperware <br/>
was in the stream, the stamped pages of the logbook were torn out and <br/>
in the proper hiding space, the rest of the logbook was missing, and <br/>
we found the stamp crammed into a crack in the bridge!  So we <br/>
reassembled everything we had, but I was worried that the destruction <br/>
of the box had been intentional (and repeatable), so we placed box #2 <br/>
WITH box #3 to leave it for Jen to decide if she wants to put it back <br/>
in its original spot or find a new place.<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone is looking for #2, it's currently hanging out with #3, <br/>
waiting for a (new?) home.<br/>
