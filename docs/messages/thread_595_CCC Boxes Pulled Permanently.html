<br/>
Last night the pups and I went over to the CCC Nature Trail in Auburn to check on my "Lucy and Clifford's Wildlife Adventure" series that I have hidden there.  I meant to just check on it, but I found 4 of the 9 boxes either badly re-hidden or not rehidden at all... just left out in plain sight or wedged into an area and not covered. One was just dropped behind a boulder, instead of rehidden in the nook underneath the boulder and then covered with brush. Grrr. Because this is a high-volume trail, I decided to permanently pull this series.  I'm sorry for the lack of notice. I meant to pull them in November if they were left out like my other series in Auburn, but when I saw how lackadaisical the hiding was yesterday, I decided not to wait.<br/>
<br/>
I did not have a chance to change my website to reflect their retirement, so I wanted to let the list know.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I took a picture of one of the boxes which had been re-"hidden" by being wedged into the lowest branch of a tree... in full view! Before it had been in a hand-sewn camoflauge bag, up in the well-firred evergreen boughs.  I posted it in my blog:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://trailhoundz.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trailhoundz.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit peeved, to say the least.  How HARD is it to re-hide a box, as good as or better than you found it?!?!  *sigh*  :^{<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry for the lack of notice.  Thank you to all the boxers who found and enjoyed (and rehid properly!) this series previously... I had a great time carving each image and really enjoyed everyone's signature stamps and comments in the logbooks.   I know Auburn is quite a hike from Syracuse and from surrounding areas, so the fact that many of you took time to drive out and look for them is very special to me. Thank you! :o)<br/>

was just heading up that way this weekend to get the last couple of<br/>
boxes, too...<br/>
<br/>
It is because of this, that I have planned a different game for the<br/>
Desperately Seeking Sun event this Feb.  Instead of the BINGO game, I<br/>
have designed a game to test re-hiding skills. Contestants are given<br/>
three different rehiding "scenarios." (These are sets I am building in<br/>
my home, as we speak!)  Contestants will be given a bag of rehiding<br/>
materials, and will have to rehide a container in each of the sets,<br/>
and will be TIMED. Judges will then determine if their efforts will<br/>
keep the box from being compromised. The person with the fastest time<br/>
who has been given the "thumbs up" from our judges (who will work and<br/>
vote as a group)  will win the prize. <br/>
<br/>
Would you be interested in joining my panel of judges? Let me know!<br/>

<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">I think Jen is being very diplomatic 
here.  The truth is these boxes were found by some new boxers just 
yesterday morning and she came along and found them exposed that evening!  
It wasn't as though these boxes sat out for months without being found so that 
time and weather possibly had an opportunity to expose them.  These boxes 
were exposed strictly because someone didn't care enough to take the time and 
effort to rehide them properly.</font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">This was a great series and now it is being 
pulled and retired.  That is a shame.  These boxes were planted on a 
very highly traveled trail but they were hid properly.  Budgie and I found 
this series at the beginning of the summer and during the summer, they were 
found numerous times.  None went missing.  Now, because of someone's 
lack of care, they are pulled.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">If you have found this series, her Outwit, 
Outlast, Outplay or Bark at the Park boxes, you are familiar with how she made 
camouflage bags for the boxes.  How the heck does a camouflage bag for a 
box go missing?  You know that you found the box tied in a tree in a 
bag.  And then you just stick it back on a branch?  Walk home with the 
bag?  She also told me that me that one of the stamps was missing from a 
box.  Hey, I know stuff happens, you can get distracted when you are 
stamping in and trying to be stealthy (that last 'stealthy' part can be 
read as sarcastic if you are so inclined  :-)) but how do you walk off 
with a stamp???  And if you do, what?  You just keep it, add it to 
your own collection?  C'mon people!  Either make a return trip to 
replace it or at the very least notify the planter and offer to send it back to 
them.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">What should she do?  Notify the last 
finders and tell them?  Educate them about proper rehiding?  The 
problem with that is it is reactive instead of proactive.  She is 
lucky that she came along when she did, because on that trail, those boxes, 
hidden the way they were, would have been gone in a day or two.  I am all 
for educating new boxers, I just don't see why our boxes have to be sacrificed 
to do so.  One thing I have learned in the past year is that no one thinks 
they rehide poorly.  I even know of one boxer who when notified that 
the boxes they found last were left exposed claimed they were 'sabotaged'.  
Right.  Someone came along, found the boxes you supposedly rehid so 
wonderfully and just exposed them, taking nothing, doing nothing with 
them.  Just found them somehow, even though you did such an awesome job 
hiding them, and left them in the open.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">    </font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">Sorry if I sound a little harsh but I find 
this extremely disappointing.  This was a nice series, in a nice little 
location, with nice stamps.  And now it has been pulled.  Trailhoundz 
has done a great job in making Auburn a worthy destination for 
a letterboxing daytrip and I hate to see this happen to her boxes.

I am going to drive out and check my other boxes tonight to see if they were properly rehidden... oh boy, I hope they were rehid properly--!<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to also try to compose a courteous "FYI" email about the importance of rehiding, since they are registered on AQ so I can email them directly. They are newbies (just registered 2 weeks ago) so I don't want to embarrass them, but I definitely want to let them know that the boxes were left unhidden and remind them on the importance of hiding boxes.   I don't want to discourage them from the hobby nor embarrass them though--we all make mistakes--so how do I compose an "educational" email without sounding like a nag or possessive box owner?!  ARG, I HATE being put in this position!!!   Why can't people just REHIDE properly?!?! It's common SENSE!!!  :o(<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-182496253">I'll start by saying that the timing on this makes me lean towards  <br/>
the scenario mentioned - new boxers not hiding well after stamping  <br/>
in. I can also see the wisdom in making the educational email very  <br/>
diplomatic because I can see some other possibilities for a series  <br/>
left out......<br/>
<br/>
Not at all likely in this case due to location and visibility, but  <br/>
maybe previous boxers rehid something poorly and new boxers who came  <br/>
along later did put them back where they found them. Still should  <br/>
have followed the clues instead of the poor re-hiding job, but I can  <br/>
see it happening. (You mean I'm supposed to pay attention? I can't be  <br/>
spoonfed all the time?)<br/>
<br/>
Possible in many cases - the last boxers to stamp in rehid well, but  <br/>
the boxers after them got the stamp image, didn't stamp in (it's all  <br/>
about the count and my own logbook, right? why spend time stamping  <br/>
in?), and rehid poorly.<br/>
<br/>
I am sooooo not saying that's what happened here or that anywhere  <br/>
near every new boxer would do these things - I believe that most  <br/>
boxers do make a reasonably informed start. I'm just over-thinking  <br/>
ahead. Right now I have exactly one traditional plant. Though I do  <br/>
have several more ready to go, I'm delaying planting those while I  <br/>
figure out how I personally want to deal with all of this. Jen - I'm  <br/>
kind of hoping that if they reply to you, you let us know in general  <br/>
terms how it went. The more info I have, the better I'll feel about  <br/>
however I decide to go with my plants. I'd reallyreallyreally prefer  <br/>
not to go totally WOM or deal with my own webpage, but I guess it's  <br/>
an option.<br/>

am SO sorry that this series had to be pulled, but I agree that you <br/>
were right to do so. I'm just thankful that Dandelion and I had the <br/>
chance to search out that series because I treasure all of your <br/>
stamps. They're always so well done and...well...  I'm think I'm just <br/>
speechless. There is no excuse for "hiding" a box in such a manner as <br/>
this. I don't care if you're caught in a lightning storm at 2am, with <br/>
a pack of rabid rabbits breathing down your neck. Completely <br/>
inexcusable. Our only hope is that perhaps these new boxers aren't <br/>
local. I'm sorry if that's rude, but I'm disgusted.<br/>
<br/>
Jen, at the very least, think of all the fun art projects using that <br/>
series of stamps that you'll now be able to do in the comfort of your <br/>
home!<br/>

I really hesitate to even mention this, but I actually visited the Nature Trail boxes for a check up yesterday evening and probably only missed you by a couple of hours.  As I went to check the letterboxes, I noticed that 4 of the 9 had not been rehidden very well. Two of the 4 were fully exposed with no cover over them. I just thought I would send a friendly reminder to rehide letterboxes thoroughly after finding them, as good as, or better, than you found them.  :o)  Sometimes it's hard to remember because you get so excited to go to the next box, but an exposed letterbox risks being found by non-boxers &amp; stolen, or becoming litter.  A lot of times, if I find a box exposed or half-exposed, I'll search around for more sticks, rocks, debris, etc. to put on top, adding to what was originally there.  Afterwards I check from all sides to make sure it's invisable and blending totally in to the environment. Stealth and secrecy... all part of the game! :o)<br/>

I noticed you are new to AQ... if you have any questions about getting around the boards, or about letterboxing in general, let me know and I'd be glad to help. I've been boxing for about 2 years now and enjoy it immensely. It's a great way to get outside, hike with the pups, and enjoy the great outdoors. <br/>

Have a great weekend!  <br/>

<p><font face="arial">I completely agree with you; I haven't planted a traditional box in awhile because I don't know the best way to produce the clues.  I want to make my Harry Potter series super hard to find so the noxers &amp; under-committed boxers will give up before they find them.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial">I've been toying with writing everything in code, writing in a foreign language, using a book and doing one of those codes that you solve by looking at a word on a particular page (there's a name for that but I don't remeber what it is).  I don't get out in public enough to just have clues in my pocket written in caligraphy on tattered scraps of parchment.  That would be my first choice!  You can come up to me in the pub, buy me a Guiness, whisper the key word, and I'll trade you one parchment for one Guiness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Since I don't hang out in pubs, maybe I'll hand out clues to everyone who stops by my house, mows an acre of lawn, whispers the keyword.... wait, I'm bordering on extortion here.</font></p>

&gt; I really hesitate to even mention this, but I actually visited the<br/>
Nature Trail boxes for a check up yesterday evening and probably only<br/>

Sometimes it's hard to remember because you get so excited to go to<br/>
the next box, but an exposed letterbox risks being found by non-boxers<br/>
&amp; stolen, or becoming litter.  A lot of times, if I find a box exposed<br/>
or half-exposed, I'll search around for more sticks, rocks, debris,<br/>
etc. to put on top, adding to what was originally there.  Afterwards I<br/>
check from all sides to make sure it's invisable and blending totally<br/>
in to the environment. Stealth and secrecy... all part of the game! :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I noticed you are new to AQ... if you have any questions about<br/>
getting around the boards, or about letterboxing in general, let me<br/>
know and I'd be glad to help. I've been boxing for about 2 years now<br/>
and enjoy it immensely. It's a great way to get outside, hike with the<br/>
pups, and enjoy the great outdoors. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a great weekend!  <br/>
