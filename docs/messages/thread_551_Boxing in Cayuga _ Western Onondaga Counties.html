Currently all the animals that have attacked people have been Red foxes and Gray Foxes-- in the areas of Sennett (area outside of Skaneateles and Auburn), Fleming, Niles, and yesterday three people were attacked by a Gray Fox in the village of Weedsport, which is near Port Byron and Jordan.  <br/>
<br/>
Be alert when you're boxing in the woods and if you box with your pups, make sure they are up-to-date on their Rabies vaccinations.  And if you see any animals acting strange, slobbering, walking drunkenly, acting aggressive, or out during the day when they are a nocturnal species...make a mad dash out of there.<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to carry your carving tools with you for protection (okay, just kidding on that one!).<br/>
<br/>
No reason to stop boxing, but one more reason to be alert when out in the trail.<br/>
