                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-405542245">When carving with the razor knife, you always want to hold the blade <br/>
at an angle, so the rubber remaining is narrowest at the inking <br/>
surface and gets broader below.  And you must constantly keep in mind <br/>
which way is which, otherwise you may undercut some of the rubber <br/>
inking surface.  You'll eventually need to learn to cut with the <br/>
blade moving either towards you or away from you.<br/>
<br/>
At first, make as shallow a cut as you can make, just barely <br/>
scratching the surface of the rubber with the very point of the <br/>
blade.  Go over the entire pattern that way before making any deep <br/>
cuts or removing any rubber at all.  While cutting, remember that the <br/>
location of the blade is less important than the location of the edge <br/>
of the blade.  In fact, you can often cut tiny zig-zags without <br/>
lifting the knife; just twist, and it'll push the rubber out of the <br/>
way as it cuts sideways.<br/>
<br/>
For all of you magnificent carvers out there, could someone please <br/>
explain this to me in English.  for example, what is undercutting? Do <br/>
you hold the blade at an angle with the blade on the line you want to <br/>
cut and the handle lower towards you?  When talking about the rubber <br/>
being narrowest at the inking surface and broader below, what exactly <br/>
does that mean?  I have tried to carve 6 stamps.  Three with an Xacto <br/>
and 3 with a speedball and none of them look like the image.  I have <br/>
tried both negative and positive carving.  They are all awful.  I <br/>
want to be able to carve my own so others don't have to do it for <br/>
me.  Thanks for any help.  I'm getting desperate.  PS I have used <br/>
erasers, speedy cut and the pink stuff.</div>

Did you trace the image, then turn it over and rub it onto the carving<br/>
medium? I rub it on with the edge of a coin and that seems to work very<br/>
well for me. If you are doing that it should look like the image. Then you<br/>
have to decide what part of it looks best positive or negative. I also find<br/>
that I get a MUCH  better and clearer image rubbed on  if I carve on PZ cut<br/>
grade B. Sometimes it's easier to move the piece of carving stuff rather<br/>
than move the carving tool. <br/>
<br/>
I used to use the pink stuff until Mizscarlet turned me onto PZ Cut Grade<br/>
B. Now I won't carve on anything else. I don't like Mastercarve and some<br/>
swear by it. I do all of my carving with the smallest speedball tool,<br/>
except for large areas I want to get rid of, so I can't help with any Xacto<br/>
advice. I prefer positive carving. Are you using a magnifying light. Makes<br/>
a :::::HUGE:::: difference, at least for me. You can get a lamp that goes<br/>
on the side of a desk or table or magnifying glasses you wear on your head<br/>
like a miner's thingie. I prefer the tabel model. You'll get tons of<br/>
different advice and methods from different people. You have to find what<br/>
works best for you.<br/>
