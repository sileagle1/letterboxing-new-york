I sat up into the wee hours of the night at Crafty &amp; Dan's place after DSS<br/>
and read that book! Important safety tip: do NOT read books with spooky<br/>
stuff in them unless you're in the safety of your own home! It's bad enough<br/>
to be creeped out in your OWN space! :-)<br/>

disgust and handing her a woobie to cling to) Highlander<br/>
