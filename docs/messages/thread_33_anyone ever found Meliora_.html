soon...ROchester is only about 45 minutes from us (also only about an <br/>
hour from the Western NY gathering, so don't feel like the drive'll <br/>
kill ya...come on out and join us!)<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you find it, though...it's on our list, along with <br/>

&gt; I read in the big list archives that Roc'nRon and jackbear have had <br/>
&gt; unsuccessful searches for this series. I'll be on the UofR campus <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; Monday and would like to at least try, so I was wondering if anyone <br/>
&gt; has had better luck recently. I've tried contacting James through <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; LBNA contact the placer link but thought I'd ask here as well while <br/>
&gt; waiting to see if I get a response from him.<br/>

&gt; Thanks so much,<br/>
