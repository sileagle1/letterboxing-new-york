really into the stamping).We did the Montezuma Box by Cock 0'the Trail <br/>
(in fine shape with all new blank pages ready to fill!) and the Spook <br/>
Hill (Middlesex, NY) box by JeLyBean..which was wayyyy cool. My dad got <br/>
a BIG grin on his face when his car started to slowly roll backwards <br/>
and uphill...a lot of fun. It was nice to see familiar stamps in the <br/>
logbooks too. The rusted metal is missing but the flat stone was still <br/>
there hiding the box well. <br/>
<br/>
Also planted some boxes too...one at Chimney Bluffs (in the undeveloped <br/>
end of the state park), one in Lyons, NY ( home of Jim Boeheim although <br/>
the stamp is of something else entirely) and one in Kueka Park at Kueka <br/>
College ( my mom's alma mater.)  A beautiful day for boxing.  I will be <br/>
posting the clues for the new boxes later this evening.<br/>

heading towards $3.00 a gallon. lol<br/>
<br/>
Hardly anytime for boxing this week as I prepare to send off my 20 <br/>
year old to Colorado (got a better job offer/college deal than the <br/>
one in Alaska so plans have changed) and my 18 year old to Florida. <br/>
*sigh* Boxing would be such a nice diversion for the swirling <br/>
emotions I am experiencing but alas...<br/>
<br/>
Did manage to stop by and check my "All Natural" box at the ESF <br/>
Experimental Station near Jamesville on the way to a dentist <br/>
appointment. And of course I couldn't check on my box without <br/>
searching out Catbead's new plant, eh? (Pirate Gear Required) Of <br/>
course her camoflaging skills must be at the highest level because I <br/>
LITERALLY left no stone unturned trying to find the final hiding <br/>
place! I am sure the dentist was amused at my moss smeared jeans and <br/>
mussed hair. Guess this means I'll be back. But the question <br/>
is...will I be back before WINK gets there?!?<br/>
<br/>
Soothed my nerves by finding Catbead's "At the Cat" and was amused to <br/>
see that Dagonell had beat me to it. Hmmm...had Dagonell found the <br/>
Pirate box first as well??? Had to FORCE myself to drive by Catbead's <br/>
house without stopping and begging for hints.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Spent a couple of hours studying topographical maps to seek out other <br/>
hiding spots...no time for carving this week. A pile of completed <br/>
boxes (mostly for the Adirondacks) stares me in the face..but it <br/>
looks like I will have to be patient and wait for the end of the <br/>
summer to plant them. So much to do....so little time!<br/>
<br/>
What's everyone else been up to since the weather cooled?<br/>

Leprechan's Revenge sign-in box at the Utica Train Station and was <br/>
happy to see that people were still doing the series..despite 2 of the <br/>
6 nano-boxes that have gone missing. They WILL be replaced. Also did <br/>
some of Paul in SF's boxes and the great boxes hidden by MisDeesCrew <br/>
while in the Oriskany area. One logbook was soggy so I dried it out on <br/>
my car's heat vents and another was missing, but I contacted the <br/>

managed to grab 6 boxes in the rain before I got home. Whew!<br/>

I just sent out my carving of Charlie Chan for the Pepe's Great <br/>
Flamingo Caper. Although I won't be attending, they promised to plant <br/>
it where I could visit it on my way through to see my brother in Dover, <br/>
NH. I am working on a few more box ideas including a Halloween box and <br/>
also finishing up a "special project" as well. This week will <br/>
be "maintenance week"  and I have already retired some boxes <br/>
permanently.<br/>
<br/>
Now just waiting for cooler weather to plant my Adirondack boxes!<br/>

<div>Ahhhhhh! Music to my ears LockWench! :o) What area of the ADK's are you planning to visit--? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As soon as Lucy's stitches come out, we are heading up for some letterboxing around the Old Forge/Inlet/Eagle Bay area.  Looks like some folks have been busy planting because there weren't that many when I passed through that area July 4th on my way to Saranac Lake! Yahoo!  Unfortunately it looks like most of the DEC/State campgrounds close Labor Day, which means... uh... we might have to do wilderness camping. Ick. No potties, no showers... :o(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But... for all these new letterboxes... and for the beauty of the ADK's... we will do it! ;oD</div>

so bad I had to pull in....so the Utica Curling Club won! LOL  Hey <br/>
maybe I'll do the Shriner's anyway and you Utica/Rome folks can have <br/>
even more to hunt down.   If I knew where you lived I would have <br/>
stopped in for sure for a cup of hot coffee. That rain was intense but <br/>
nothing compared to what those poor Gulf Post folks are dealing with....<br/>
Anyone heard from Boxdn? Wonder how he is doing...<br/>
<br/>
Paul - I often wish I still had my Suzuki moped. Ah..those were the <br/>
days..delivering pizzas all over Syracuse with the wind in my hair! <br/>
lol. I remember I got about 100-120 mpg.<br/>
<br/>
Jen - The first two I have to hide are Bald Mt. at Old Forge (short <br/>
with a great view of the Fulton Chain of Lakes and a good "beginner's <br/>
mountain") and Chimney Mountain near Indian Lake. Chimney is my <br/>
favorite Adirondack Mt. as it is right on the water....has beautiful <br/>
trails with nice ponds, a rock climbing "chimney" is at the top and <br/>
there are cool caves to explore..some with ice in them in the middle of <br/>
the summer! A good intermediate mountain for families. Not too long a <br/>
hike either. I have other carvings I am working on for the Adirondacks <br/>
as well but it will depend on family stuff to see how many I get <br/>
planted up there this fall. I have one  for the Elizabethtown watershed <br/>
area, Siamese Ponds, Cathead and Black Bear.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to find good spots because there are so many frikking <br/>
geocaches that I have to check each place out pretty well.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-282837398">I had a very productive letterboxing day this week. I decided to make <br/>
it a "Lisascenic Day" and capture some of her stamp images now that <br/>
the majority of the tourists are gone. Most of her boxes are hidden <br/>
in my old childhood stomping grounds so I knew I wouldn't get lost! <br/>
First I took the Thruway to Canajoharie and went for her Canajoharie <br/>
box near the Academy. I didn't find it but only because the sidewalk <br/>
mentioned in the clue had been recently replaced. I checked every <br/>
nook and cranny but no box. Did anyone else find it recently?<br/>
<br/>
Next I headed to the "potholes"...a swimming area we went to many <br/>
times as kids. I still got excited when I saw the traffic light that <br/>
is in the middle of the intersection. As a kid, that meant we were <br/>
really close to our destination! I found the Green Barn box with no <br/>
problem, then hopped in my car and headed south to Sharon Springs, <br/>
saving the other Canajoharie boxes in Wintergreen Park for another <br/>
day. After all, this trip was for Lisa's boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Got into Sharon Springs and immediately went for the Healing Waters <br/>
box but there were still a ton of tourists milling about! I <br/>
remembered back to my first trip as a child and my fascination with <br/>
all the Hasidic Jews I saw here. The boys especially with their long <br/>
curls on either side of their faces..hats tight on their heads. I <br/>
decided to save this box for another time and went to the Block <br/>
Printing Nirvana box instead. What a fabulous stamp! I was so happy <br/>
to get this one and headed down Route 20 to get the Wild Strawberries <br/>
and Our Friends the Amish stamps. I was FF on the Strawberries...and <br/>
the location is one of the hidden treasures of NYS. My parents had <br/>
brought me here as a child and I know I made my mom nervous as I <br/>
scrambled all over the cliffs. <br/>
<br/>
After the Amish stamp I headed down to Cooperstown and got the Opera <br/>
Series (I used to visit the Goodyear mansion next door as I went to <br/>
high school with one of their relatives) and then got the Secret of <br/>
Mirror Bay by Lisa and the Dream Team series by the girlguides. <br/>
Frank's box in the Dream Team series was obviously missing and I <br/>
didn't have time to grab the Brewery stamp...but I will be back! I <br/>
had a lovely drive back up Route 28...(repaved since my last time <br/>
here) and went down memory lane as I traveled down Vickerman Hill <br/>
into Mohawk. I grew up in the town next door and it was always <br/>
thrilling to hear about runaway trucks that were saved from disaster <br/>
because of the runaway stop ramp that had been built. Prior to that, <br/>
out parents used to regal us with stories about trucks spilling their <br/>
cargos of potatoes and oranges..and once a runaway truck filled with <br/>
TNT ran straight throught the town of Mohawk! whew!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lisa...for a great day. I thank the girlguides as well. Even <br/>
better...I had dinner at the Glen Loch and finally picked up the last <br/>
That Darn Cat stamp! woo hoo!!<br/>

here, which is that lisascenic's carving is really good--her stamps <br/>
are the most beautiful in my book so far, and well worth the trip!  <br/>
And it sounds like I'll have to get to that stamp shop next summer!  <br/>
There's also a good vintage clothing dealer in the same building.  <br/>
Yay!<br/>
<br/>
I had a great day of boxing on Saturday.  Chris and I rode our bikes <br/>
out to the outer harbor to get the Times Beach stamp.  What a great <br/>
spot!  Not many people have gone for this one, but it was definately <br/>
worth it.  Much more overgrown I think than when the box was <br/>
hidden.  :)  We ended up biking about 15 miles (the route home was <br/>
circuitous) and checking out some other spots to hide boxes in <br/>
downtown Buffalo on our way back.  There will be a series soon....<br/>

I also moved my Furnace Brook Trail box after finding it right out in <br/>
the open twice. It is in a better hiding spot now. Be careful if you <br/>
do this trail though, as there has been quite a lot of flooding in <br/>
the area. You can easily double back on the trail rather than doing <br/>
the whole loop, however.  I decided to "tough" it out..what the <br/>
heck..I am an experienced backpacker and all....  Bad idea. I got to <br/>
the stream and the temporary bridge was long gone. In it's place, <br/>
someone had thoughtfully places haybales, stumps, and logs. Each <br/>
separately..so you could choose your poison. <br/>
<br/>
The haybales looked the safest to me so I started across. <br/>
Yipes..waterlogged haybales! My feet were now soaked as I was wearing <br/>
running shoes. I lept back to shore and eyed the stumps. They were <br/>
uneven and quite tall but I decided to try it. Eek! Even worse! They <br/>
sank and twisted on their mud foundations and I seriously saw my life <br/>
flashing before my eyes...so back to shore I went. The logs laid <br/>
crosswise certainly looked dry on top. And they were nice and even <br/>
and low to the ground..what the heck. I'll bite. Two steps on and I <br/>
realized my error. Have you ever seen those log rolling contests? <br/>
Well, imagine that with a middle aged woman on top. yow zah! I barely <br/>
made it across to the other side! I kept looking for the Candid <br/>
Camera guy to jump out of the bushes..I bet someone could make <br/>
serious money with that novelty footage. Of course, you would have to <br/>
edit out all the things I uttered while attempting to cross the <br/>
stream...<br/>
<br/>
I'll be heading out to explore  3 Falls Woods ( in Manlius) a little <br/>
more before I plant there. If anyone has been there before and can <br/>
tell me how to get to the limekilns..would you please contact me <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1667972325">OK..the I Love NY hitchhiker Hostel is up and running with 5 new<br/>
hitchhikers.  It is an adapted from a design by Alafair...who planted<br/>
the first "I Love NY HH Hostel"  in Cortand NY back in July of 2003.<br/>
You are free to look through the new logbook but please do not take a<br/>
hitchhiker unless you have one to share. I myself prefer to find HHs<br/>
"in the wild" but hostels are a great way to get your HH's further out<br/>
there and to see stamp carvers from all over. Remember: TAKE a<br/>
Hitchhiker - LEAVE a Hitchhiker.  I have located it as close as I can<br/>
to major thoughfares to encourage out of towners to visit and share<br/>
HH's. The ROUND TRIP drive time from the thruway is less than 15<br/>
minutes..and from 81 north and south it is less than 5 minutes. So, no<br/>
excuses not to stop!!<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don't have a HH to share, please visit and stamp into the<br/>
Hostel logbook and collect the stamp. This counts as a traditional<br/>
letterbox find. Also, I would like to publicly thank Celtic Quinn for<br/>
donating 3 of the HH's to "seed" the hostel.<br/>
<br/>
I have been very busy doing maintenance on my 100+ boxes. Some missing<br/>
boxes will probably be retired..and some replaced. Thank you for<br/>
everyone who sends me status reports. I am checking each box<br/>
personally before I render a verdict. I appreciate all of your patience.<br/>
<br/>
Buh Buh Buh Bennie has been found and put back in his ORIGINAL spot.<br/>
The clues have been changed to reflect this. I will be posting a<br/>
status report of my boxes, thus far for those who are interested.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-365671592">What a great day for boxing! I stopped by the I Love NY HH Hostel and <br/>
was pleased to see some new HH's in there. I have a feeling it will <br/>
be very busy on Thanksgiving week! <br/>
<br/>
Then I drove out to Rochester to attend the High Falls Film Festival <br/>
as part of my work. Of course all work and no play make Lock Wench a <br/>
dull girl, so I went early enough to do some boxing. Picked up <br/>
Chemist Kahuna's very popular "Barge Canal Lock 32" box as well as <br/>
the "Canal Boats to Mighty Oaks" by noydb. Very interesting area. <br/>
Then headed to Cobb's Reservoir to find some more boxes. No problem <br/>
finding the Sprite and the Highlander's "Weebls- Scampi" box. Great <br/>
hiding place and even a HH! What a surprise to find one of Catbead's <br/>
HHs, after it has been traveling all over the country. Went to find <br/>
Team Woods "The Woods" but there were muggles everywhere!!! I'll have <br/>
to leave it for another trip. Also managed to nab noydb's "Ornery <br/>
Rhino", despite the huge wedding party posing for pictures nearby. <br/>
<br/>
I really wanted to find more boxes but thought I had better head to <br/>
the theatre. Found the theatre..hung out with friends and then went <br/>
to grab a bite to eat. Found I still had some time, so carved a <br/>
letterbox while still at my table..then went and planted it! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Then it was time to see the featured film for the evening...Sarah <br/>
Silverman's Jesus is Magic. Sarah is a VERY politically incorrect <br/>
Jewish comic..and she is HILARIOUS. The theatre was sold out and I <br/>
was glad that I had ordered my tickets early. There was just a big <br/>
article about her in this month's Rolling Stone and this film will <br/>
certainly make her a star.<br/>
<br/>
Drove home under a clear sky and vowed to return to grab the rest of <br/>
the Rochester boxes next time....<br/>

Oxbow Falls Park and Old Fly Marsh are nice places that don't get many <br/>
visitors. Why not check them out?<br/>
<br/>
I have a box ready to plant on May 24th...and I sent another to the <br/>
West Coast to be planted. I now have about 7 boxes out of 196 that <br/>
have been planted for me by others. I think I still prefer planting my <br/>
own. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the Rocks event. Not sure, but I might bring a box <br/>
to plant there. I will certainly bring a hitchhiker and some cooties, <br/>
if nothing else. I've been excited to see all the new boxes being <br/>
planted. Can't wait to go and find some!<br/>

square mile. I don't know what is up, but I have decided to retire <br/>
the two series, and wait and rehide the singles in slightly <br/>
different spots.  Weird, huh? <br/>
<br/>
What's even weirder is what happened later. I got home and was SOOO <br/>
drained of energy. My right wrist looked swollen (the one without <br/>
the tattoo) and I was getting really concerned. As my energy level <br/>
went lower and lower, I decided to just put away my things and make <br/>
an early night of it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you wouldn't believe what I found when I emptied my black <br/>
boxing bag! You might have seen me with this bag before..it's from <br/>
the film festival I work for and is great for boxing.I stuck my hand <br/>
in to get any last leaves or stray markertops and pulled out a <br/>
cootie!!! And not just ANY cootie..but a Celtic Quinn Cootie!! It <br/>
was round with 6 legs with distinctive Celtic markings on it's back. <br/>
It tried to scuttle away but I grabbed it and held it fast for <br/>
closer examination. And then the unthinkable happened! It squirted <br/>
gas from its butt...which rose like some sort of pagan smoke <br/>
ring...until it formed the letters..... "C"....."Q".  I screamed and <br/>
dropped it so quickly that I think it was stunned...as it could <br/>
barely drag itself away.  A little braver now that it was wounded, I <br/>
picked it up and quickly realized my error. It WASN'T wounded...it <br/>
was only pretending! With a wink and a mischievous grin, it dove <br/>
back into my black bag, where it attached itself to the fabric.<br/>
<br/>
"Ho HO," I muttered. "It's not going to get off THAT easily!" I <br/>
vowed to get rid of this Puck-like character as soon as possible! My <br/>
mind raced as I tried to think where I could have encountered such a <br/>
horrible thing. My only guess is at the Ithaca/Finger Lakes gather, <br/>
for I have seen scarce boxers since that event. I spent the rest of <br/>
the weekend rubbing my right wrist cootie-bite and planning my next <br/>
move. And exacting my revenge on the originator of this horrid <br/>

<p>I had the craziest weekend. I spent it doing maintenance on my boxes <br/>and discovered a grouping that was completely missing. Not just one <br/>or one series, but 2 series and a couple of singles..all within one <br/>square mile. I don't know what is up, but I have decided to retire <br/>the two series, and wait and rehide the singles in slightly <br/>different spots. Weird, huh? <br/><br/>What's even weirder is what happened later. I got home and was SOOO <br/>drained of energy. My right wrist looked swollen (the one without <br/>the tattoo) and I was getting really concerned. As my energy level <br/>went lower and lower, I decided to just put away my things and make <br/>an early night of it.<br/><br/>Well, you wouldn't believe what I found when I emptied my black <br/>boxing bag! You might have seen me with this bag before..it's from <br/>the film festival I work for and is great for boxing.I stuck my hand <br/>in to get any last leaves or stray markertops and pulled out a <br/>cootie!!! And not just ANY cootie..but a Celtic Quinn Cootie!! It <br/>was round with 6 legs with distinctive Celtic markings on it's back. <br/>It tried to scuttle away but I grabbed it and held it fast for <br/>closer examination. And then the unthinkable happened! It squirted <br/>gas from its butt...which rose like some sort of pagan smoke <br/>ring...until it formed the letters..... "C"....."Q". I screamed and <br/>dropped it so quickly that I think it was stunned...as it could <br/>barely drag itself away. A little braver now that it was wounded, I <br/>picked it up and quickly realized my error. It WASN'T wounded...it <br/>was only pretending! With a wink and a mischievous grin, it dove <br/>back into my black bag, where it attached itself to the fabric.<br/><br/>"Ho HO," I muttered. "It's not going to get off THAT easily!"
