Gathering! Thanks to Turtle McQ for her hard work to set this up!<br/>
MtnMan had the option of going to his reunion on campus but preferred <br/>
to hang out with the letterboxers! <br/>
<br/>
For those that asked for it, you can find the recipe for the rhubarb <br/>
dish I brought on my website. It's on the Fun Page! Here is the link <br/>

<p>Also planted Leprechaun's Revenge..a new series along the Thruway between Syracuse and Utica. The clues will be posted tonight.</p>

everyone for a great time at the gathering.  We really enjoyed meeting<br/>
you all.  Thanks especially to TurtleMcQ for making our visit so much<br/>
more fun and for being so hospitable.  The letterboxing community in<br/>
Central New York seems to be top notch!  We can't wait to return,<br/>
hopefully as soon as this fall, to find more of your boxes.   Oh, and<br/>
we found our 200th box while in Ithaca as well.  A great week despite<br/>
the hotter than Georgia weather!<br/>

What Ms. Wench neglected to mention was how gracious she was with her <br/>
information, how cool her family is, and how much fun we had together.<br/>
<br/>
I've already carved a stamp based on our explorations.  I'm swamped at <br/>
the Opera (wich might just be the name of a series I recently planted, <br/>
hint hint...) but will try to get the box and clues together soon.<br/>
