created an LBNY group at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LBNY" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LBNY</a> and made <br/>
Lock Wench an owner, so all that's left is to let people join (if you <br/>
already were part of LBWNY, you're already part of this group, so don't <br/>
worry about changing anything). Paul, if you wanted to join, too, I can <br/>
go ahead and make you an owner as well, so it'll be the same as before.<br/>
<br/>
I also sent the changed logo to the t-shirt guy (who won't be starting <br/>
on it until after Labor Day, anyway. So, those of you who have changed <br/>
your mind on that, let me know so I can change the order. Again, this <br/>
doesn't earn this group or the Highlander and I any profit at all, but <br/>
it does get us a discount on what's normally a $22 shirt ($25 with <br/>
logo). We have enough already to make their minimum order, but anyone <br/>
not paying for theirs by the gathering will have to wait until there's <br/>
more people or buy it at the higher price.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps bring us together as one state...I'll understand if <br/>
folks really want to keep both groups, but the effort has been made! :-)<br/>
