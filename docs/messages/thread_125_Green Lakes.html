Diamonds</title></head>
<div>We were able to check on some of the Green Lakes boxes Sunday
(all 4  Aces) and it took me a while to find the Ace of Diamonds
because it had been moved, I almost gave up on it when I thought to
check one more place and there it was.  The landscape has changed
enough to warrant some clue revision... I'll try to get my online
clues up to date soon but just in case I don't here they are. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Replace the 2nd from the last paragraph of the clues with
this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande">"Near where the
forest stops and opens again, see a mossy thin old log, under a rock,
resting on the ground by a split trunk tree. Three of a kind will
always beat an ace" Dalliance says.</font></div>
