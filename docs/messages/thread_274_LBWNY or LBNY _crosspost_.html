                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1155313740">So, as long as we're still waiting for shirts, it occured to me that <br/>
our shirts might be more friendly if we include the rest of the state. <br/>
After all our Central NY neighbors and downstate brethern join us for <br/>
our events quite often (and vice versa) and they plant quite a bit <br/>
themselves (hence, the universality of "If You Plant It, They Will <br/>
Come"!). Would anyone have any objection to taking out the W in LBWNY <br/>
and just making the shirt say Letterboxing New York?<br/>
<br/>
Or, those of you who don't live in the WNY area...would you be more <br/>
interested in the shirts if we made a change like that? We're not <br/>
trying to sell more shirts or anything (since we're not getting any <br/>
money ourselves for this) but we suddenly felt snobby for making it <br/>
Western New York only. <br/>
<br/>
Let's hear some discussion on this...we've got about a week before <br/>
final changes can be made, so...?<br/>

<p><tt> Would anyone have any objection to taking out the W in LBWNY and just making the shirt say Letterboxing New York?</tt></p>
<p><tt>Funny that you should mention this....as the LBCNY group had a meeting this summer and discussed how best to include all New Yorkers in NY letterboxing activities. When Paul in SF started the LBCNY group over a year ago, it was because NY State had an identity crisis. Some New Yorkers felt out of place in LB Mid Atlantic group....but not quite at home in the LB Northeast. His intent was not to split NY State into separate areas, but to "centralize"  NYS letterboxing so that ALL New Yorkers could/would participate. Let's face it...we are WAYYY bigger than the tiny state of Connecticut with millions of acres of undeveloped forests,lakes,waterfalls and trails and counting NYC we have a millions of potential letterboxers. Sounds like NY State could easily stand on it's own. To be perfectly honest..and speaking ONLY for myself..and this is in NO WAY a slight to all the hard work that Sprite has done..... I was little dismayed to see the start of formal
 regional groups like LBWNY or others surely soon to follow, but maybe this is just me. I would STILL attend an LBWNY group function or a Catskills group one or an Adirondack group function or a Finger Lakes function,or...well....you get the picture. </tt></p>
<p><tt>I like the idea of there being ONE group for all of NY State, as I believe there is better identity and strength in numbers AND strength in pooled dollars.  This may seem like sacrilege to the original members of LBCNY and I would NEVER intentionally insult any of them OR their hard work. It just seems to me that it would be more "I Love New York-ish" to include everyone in one big happy group, and enjoy regional gatherings such as the Finger Lakes, the Western Gathering, the Fear Faketor or whatever. </tt></p>
<p><tt>That being said..I am not really a T shirt wearer so my vote doesn't count on the shirt change. But I gotta say I would be more enticed to buy them as gifts if it was a shirt that encompassed all of NY State. :)</tt></p>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-774978765">Thanks for the compliment and the thought provoking comments (see, I <br/>
knew when I posted here, I'd get genuine feedback...love ya, <br/>
Lockie!). I thought I better explain why we made the other group to <br/>
make sure everyone understood our motives...I'd hate for folks to <br/>
think we started a union rift. When we first chose to do a separate <br/>
group for Yahoo, it was for three reasons: <br/>
<br/>
1) Our Meetup group, where we were keeping a list of folks that would <br/>
attend our gathering, turned into a pay site, which we DID NOT want <br/>
to do. We wanted to have a central place to post gatherings for the <br/>
area (this was before AQ had an event posting spot, of course)<br/>
<br/>
2) This group was just Central New York, which led us to believe that <br/>
there were SUPPOSED to be separate groups (like a downstate group and <br/>
ourselves). We never even considered saying LBNY because it seemed <br/>
too all-encompassing for the whole state (and a little pretentious <br/>
with there already being a CNY). I don't think Paul in SF had <br/>
considered saying that either, so I'm guessing he had the same idea. <br/>
<br/>
3) Even though we've all been welcome in both groups (and have <br/>
attended gatherings in all regions), it's still relatively hard for <br/>
those of us in Buffalo/Niagara (and even Rochester) to join Syracuse <br/>
folks for boxes &amp; events and vice versa. Out of 54 people, only <br/>
Crafymouse, Dandelion, MTNestRobin &amp; MTNMan &amp; Missmoon came from CNY <br/>
&amp; downstate to our first WNY event and I think only RocNRon and <br/>
ourselves came from WNY to the Finger Lakes event. I think we and the <br/>
Quinns were the ONLY ones from WNY at Fear Faketor, so it's even more <br/>
of a challenge to head out to the Catskills and NYS way. <br/>
<br/>
We really liked how CNY folks were able to connect and get together <br/>
for boxing on the weekends, but it was out of the question for most <br/>
of us to join you. So, having a group where someone could say "Hey, <br/>
we're boxing in Willamsville...anyone want to come?" and knowing we <br/>
could actually GO was cool. It's only recently that we've seen more <br/>
folks from other areas come up to box in our neck of the woods. <br/>
<br/>
So, I wanted to be sure no one thought we did this to cause a rift in <br/>
NYS. In fact, I'd really RATHER have a whole state board and if the <br/>
shirts are part of that, I certainly don't mind (which is why I was <br/>
asking). As of late, it seems like planning events in Rochester makes <br/>
it an equal haul for everyone, so we've got a balance again. And <br/>
regardless, I don't think anyone ever considered NOT going to an <br/>
event because of the region's name (I know WE haven't!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as Yahoo groups go, I would love to merge into one solid LBNY <br/>
group, but again, I'm not sure that's something everyone would want. <br/>
Most people have a link to both groups (less with WNY, of course), <br/>
but again, all of us under Central New York makes it more of a <br/>
Syracuse/Ithaca thing than a full state thing, just like WNY suggests <br/>
Buffalo/Rochester. It's good to know that some folks are thinking <br/>
about it (especially enough to have a meeting), but even that meeting <br/>
makes it difficult to imaging us bridging the distance gap. We'dve <br/>
love to have been part of that, if we could have.<br/>
<br/>
So, regardless, I'm changing the shirt, but I think we've got a whole <br/>
other topic to consider. How can we unite under one common roof <br/>
without becoming this side and still accomodate the distance between <br/>
us all?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1006734520"><div>Oh I TOTALLY understand that you were just trying to get local WNY members under a smaller umbrella for ease in boxing, etc. But as Paul said..Central NY did not mean CENTRAL NY...in fact it was more like NY CENTRAL, as all New Yorkers were welcome to join. He was just trying to SEED Central NY because it had so few boxes! I can attest to this. When I first learned of letterboxing there were only 3 in the entire CNY area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think one group could easily share event info and other such things. I know that when I attended my first event, (Finger Lakes) there were plenty of boxers from out of the CNY area. In fact, if I had joined up earlier..the Western NY event would have been my first one. Anything that was less than a full day's drive was what I was looking for. I WILL be at the WNY event but as events are proliferating now (thanks Ryan!) I will have to be pickier or I will never see my extended family. :)   I confess that I have already been looking for Colorado and Florida events as two of my children are moving this next week!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But I believe you can STILL post to a list or even email separately a few people to box with. I have only boxed with Catbead and LisaScenic so far but am looking forward to joining others as well. Those of us in CNY have some great ideas for bringing people together and we know that the WNY boxers are a creative bunch as well. I see only one solution. We meet in the middle. :)  So I guess we'll be seeing all of you WNY and CNY boxers on the 27th in Rochester. Can't wait!</div>

<div>Let's keep the debate going!</div>

live in either CNY or WNY ... Binghamton is the<br/>
"Southern Tier" along with Elmira and other places<br/>
along the NY/PA border, so here's my $.02<br/>
<br/>
I joined both groups so that I could cover all of<br/>
upstate NY.  Syracuse is about  1 1/2 hours drive for<br/>
us, Ithaca is just under an hour.  Rochester and<br/>
Buffalo are considerably farther, but we're up there<br/>
frequently to visit friends so I wanted to get in<br/>
touch with boxers from that area as well.<br/>
<br/>
NY is a HUGE state, but not impossible to join<br/>
together.  I'd love to see the groups combine into a<br/>
big NY boxing group.  My personal preference is the<br/>
upstate boxes ... it's just too hard for me to get<br/>
down to NYC and LI, and I have a HUGE aversion to<br/>
traffic jams (chuckle), but maybe if I got to know<br/>
some of the boxers from that area of NY, I'd feel<br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, we're all interested in the same<br/>
thing ... filling up this beautiful state of ours with<br/>
as many letterboxes as we can cram into trees and<br/>
under rocks.  And that's what really matters.<br/>
<br/>
Looking SO forward to seeing everyone on the 27th ...<br/>
we'll be a bit late since we're going to the Herp show<br/>
in Syracuse that morning, but leaving in plenty of<br/>
time to get to the gathering.  <br/>

after I did mine. Looks like just a misunderstanding all the way <br/>
around. I think everyone already posts/watces both boards as well as <br/>
goes to both regional events, so we're already one group as it is. As <br/>
long as there won't be any more designation of C or W either way, I <br/>
think it'll all just a formality.<br/>
<br/>
So, let's try this! I'll go start an LBNY Yahoo group and make myself <br/>
and Lock Wench owners of the group. Celtic Quinn will still be a <br/>
moderator and everyone is fully invited. One state, under boxing, <br/>
indivisible, with stamps and ink pads for ALL! (marches around the <br/>
living room in her own private parade). I'll send a new design to the <br/>
shirt guy without the W and the word "Western" and that should do it.<br/>
<br/>
How's that (and tell me SOON if it won't work, 'cause I move quick!)?<br/>

&gt; Oh I TOTALLY understand that you were just trying to get local WNY <br/>
members under a smaller umbrella for ease in boxing, etc. But as Paul <br/>
said..Central NY did not mean CENTRAL NY...in fact it was more like <br/>
NY CENTRAL, as all New Yorkers were welcome to join. He was just <br/>
trying to SEED Central NY because it had so few boxes! I can attest <br/>
to this. When I first learned of letterboxing there were only 3 in <br/>
the entire CNY area.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I think one group could easily share event info and other such <br/>
things. I know that when I attended my first event, (Finger Lakes) <br/>
there were plenty of boxers from out of the CNY area. In fact, if I <br/>
had joined up earlier..the Western NY event would have been my first <br/>
one. Anything that was less than a full day's drive was what I was <br/>
looking for. I WILL be at the WNY event but as events are <br/>
proliferating now (thanks Ryan!) I will have to be pickier or I will <br/>
never see my extended family. :)   I confess that I have already been <br/>
looking for Colorado and Florida events as two of my children are <br/>
moving this next week!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But I believe you can STILL post to a list or even email separately <br/>
a few people to box with. I have only boxed with Catbead and <br/>
LisaScenic so far but am looking forward to joining others as well. <br/>
Those of us in CNY have some great ideas for bringing people together <br/>
and we know that the WNY boxers are a creative bunch as well. I see <br/>
only one solution. We meet in the middle. :)  So I guess we'll be <br/>
seeing all of you WNY and CNY boxers on the 27th in Rochester. Can't <br/>
wait!<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the compliment and the thought provoking comments (see, <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; knew when I posted here, I'd get genuine feedback...love ya, <br/>
&gt; Lockie!). I thought I better explain why we made the other group to <br/>
&gt; make sure everyone understood our motives...I'd hate for folks to <br/>
&gt; think we started a union rift. When we first chose to do a separate <br/>
&gt; group for Yahoo, it was for three reasons: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Our Meetup group, where we were keeping a list of folks that <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; attend our gathering, turned into a pay site, which we DID NOT want <br/>
&gt; to do. We wanted to have a central place to post gatherings for the <br/>
&gt; area (this was before AQ had an event posting spot, of course)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) This group was just Central New York, which led us to believe <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; there were SUPPOSED to be separate groups (like a downstate group <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; ourselves). We never even considered saying LBNY because it seemed <br/>
&gt; too all-encompassing for the whole state (and a little pretentious <br/>
&gt; with there already being a CNY). I don't think Paul in SF had <br/>
&gt; considered saying that either, so I'm guessing he had the same <br/>
idea. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Even though we've all been welcome in both groups (and have <br/>
&gt; attended gatherings in all regions), it's still relatively hard for <br/>
&gt; those of us in Buffalo/Niagara (and even Rochester) to join <br/>
Syracuse <br/>
&gt; folks for boxes &amp; events and vice versa. Out of 54 people, only <br/>
&gt; Crafymouse, Dandelion, MTNestRobin &amp; MTNMan &amp; Missmoon came from <br/>
CNY <br/>
&gt; &amp; downstate to our first WNY event and I think only RocNRon and <br/>
&gt; ourselves came from WNY to the Finger Lakes event. I think we and <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Quinns were the ONLY ones from WNY at Fear Faketor, so it's even <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; of a challenge to head out to the Catskills and NYS way. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We really liked how CNY folks were able to connect and get together <br/>
&gt; for boxing on the weekends, but it was out of the question for most <br/>
&gt; of us to join you. So, having a group where someone could say "Hey, <br/>
&gt; we're boxing in Willamsville...anyone want to come?" and knowing we <br/>
&gt; could actually GO was cool. It's only recently that we've seen more <br/>
&gt; folks from other areas come up to box in our neck of the woods. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I wanted to be sure no one thought we did this to cause a rift <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; NYS. In fact, I'd really RATHER have a whole state board and if the <br/>
&gt; shirts are part of that, I certainly don't mind (which is why I was <br/>
&gt; asking). As of late, it seems like planning events in Rochester <br/>
makes <br/>
&gt; it an equal haul for everyone, so we've got a balance again. And <br/>
&gt; regardless, I don't think anyone ever considered NOT going to an <br/>
&gt; event because of the region's name (I know WE haven't!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as Yahoo groups go, I would love to merge into one solid <br/>
LBNY <br/>
&gt; group, but again, I'm not sure that's something everyone would <br/>
want. <br/>
&gt; Most people have a link to both groups (less with WNY, of course), <br/>
&gt; but again, all of us under Central New York makes it more of a <br/>
&gt; Syracuse/Ithaca thing than a full state thing, just like WNY <br/>
suggests <br/>
&gt; Buffalo/Rochester. It's good to know that some folks are thinking <br/>
&gt; about it (especially enough to have a meeting), but even that <br/>
meeting <br/>
&gt; makes it difficult to imaging us bridging the distance gap. We'dve <br/>
&gt; love to have been part of that, if we could have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, regardless, I'm changing the shirt, but I think we've got a <br/>
whole <br/>
&gt; other topic to consider. How can we unite under one common roof <br/>
&gt; without becoming this side and still accomodate the distance <br/>
between <br/>
&gt; us all?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Would anyone have any objection to taking out the W in LBWNY and <br/>
&gt; just making the shirt say Letterboxing New York?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Funny that you should mention this....as the LBCNY group had a <br/>
&gt; meeting this summer and discussed how best to include all New <br/>
Yorkers <br/>
&gt; in NY letterboxing activities. When Paul in SF started the LBCNY <br/>
&gt; group over a year ago, it was because NY State had an identity <br/>
&gt; crisis. Some New Yorkers felt out of place in LB Mid Atlantic <br/>
&gt; group....but not quite at home in the LB Northeast. His intent was <br/>
&gt; not to split NY State into separate areas, but to "centralize"  NYS <br/>
&gt; letterboxing so that ALL New Yorkers could/would participate. Let's <br/>
&gt; face it...we are WAYYY bigger than the tiny state of Connecticut <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; millions of acres of undeveloped forests,lakes,waterfalls and <br/>
trails <br/>
&gt; and counting NYC we have a millions of potential letterboxers. <br/>
Sounds <br/>
&gt; like NY State could easily stand on it's own. To be perfectly <br/>
&gt; honest..and speaking ONLY for myself..and this is in NO WAY a <br/>
slight <br/>
&gt; to all the hard work that Sprite has done..... I was little <br/>
dismayed <br/>
&gt; to see the start of formal regional groups like LBWNY or others<br/>
&gt; &gt;  surely soon to follow, but maybe this is just me. I would STILL <br/>
&gt; attend an LBWNY group function or a Catskills group one or an <br/>
&gt; Adirondack group function or a Finger Lakes <br/>
function,or...well....you <br/>
&gt; get the picture. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I like the idea of there being ONE group for all of NY State, as <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; believe there is better identity and strength in numbers AND <br/>
strength <br/>
&gt; in pooled dollars.  This may seem like sacrilege to the original <br/>
&gt; members of LBCNY and I would NEVER intentionally insult any of them <br/>
&gt; OR their hard work. It just seems to me that it would be more "I <br/>
Love <br/>
&gt; New York-ish" to include everyone in one big happy group, and enjoy <br/>
&gt; regional gatherings such as the Finger Lakes, the Western <br/>
Gathering, <br/>
&gt; the Fear Faketor or whatever. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That being said..I am not really a T shirt wearer so my vote <br/>
&gt; doesn't count on the shirt change. But I gotta say I would be more <br/>
&gt; enticed to buy them as gifts if it was a shirt that encompassed all <br/>
&gt; of NY State. :)<br/>

of a general yahoo group for all of NY...I'd like to hear about everything 
happening in the state, not just in the area I live in...i mean, I don't live 
over in Stanfordville, NY, where they held the Fear Faketor gathering, but I 
still ended up going (and thank god I did- unbelievable!) . I'd like to hear 
about stuff going on like events and little letterboxing outings, without having 
to check AQ Event boards and seeing where they are being held, or without having 
to email EVERY LETTERBOXER I KNOW just to see who's going where or out where to 
do some letterboxing...</font></div>

Particularly because my backyard isn't particularly big, so i'll need to clean 
up first.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree that I think we're one group already. We 
might as well just kill both groups that are there now, and create the large, 
general NY group. Besides...got a message that really only applies to people in 
WNY? That's what the 'Subject' line is for- "WNY boxers- 
blahblahblahblah...".</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for the shirt...I like the design as it is. I'd 
still like it just as much if we remove the W. Either's fine for me. To be 
honest, I think it's only an issue for people who AREN'T WNY boxers, and 
therfore, they should speak up. On the other hand, if they're gonna be at the 
gathering on the 27th, they're technically WNY boxers then, and therefore the 
shirt is correctly labeled for them anyway.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Make it universal- it'll still work fine. But keep 
in mind, your original design had the W in it. Must have felt right at one time

&gt; I'd love to get one with just LBNY if possible at this late date. <br/>
&gt; The only reason I didn't order one before is because I don't live in <br/>
&gt; WNY, I love the design and having seen the shirt in person know that <br/>
&gt; it's well made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
