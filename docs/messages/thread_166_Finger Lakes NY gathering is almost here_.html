Subject: Finger Lakes NY gathering is almost here!<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about coming to the Finger Lakes Gathering in Ithaca, NY next<br/>
Saturday, June 11th from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.? We've already heard from more<br/>
than sixty attendees-to-be representing at least six states and one foreign<br/>
country (O, Canada!) and have plenty of room for more.<br/>
<br/>
New boxes have been sprouting up all over the place along with the<br/>
wildflowers and weeds around here, so there's more reason than ever to<br/>
visit even if you've been to Ithaca before. Word on the street (and in the<br/>
towers) is that one particular Tompkins County mystery box will be slightly<br/>
more available than usual on the day of the gathering, and it's one you<br/>
don't want to miss.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, many new details have been posted here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=2</a><br/>
<br/>
As always, we'd be happy to answer any questions about the gathering and<br/>
the Ithaca area, so feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see many of you next weekend,<br/>
<br/>
TurtleMcQ and Mama Bear<br/>

If you consider Geneseo, in Livingston County, in the Letchworth area,
you might try for the "Tripoli" box. Imagine the prestige that would go
with finding a box that was placed over 1000 years ago. Especially if
you could bring that proof to the gathering. In fact, I just might try
unearth that one myself next week, so look for my stamp.<br/>
