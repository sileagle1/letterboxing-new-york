                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-85957782">I recently contacted the regional office for my area and was told that <br/>
each park manager has some discretion, based on past experiences with <br/>
geocachers and letterboxers. This is good or bad depending if you are <br/>
a "glass half full" person or a "glass half empty" person. Being a <br/>
glass half full person myself, I am going in with a positive attitude <br/>
and a willingness to educate park staff on responsible letterboxing in <br/>
their parks. Of course I will be notifying them only of my own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Fire in the hole! I'm going in! <br/>

Send a St. Bernard with a flask of Ithaca Apricot Wheat if you don't <br/>
hear back from me in a week...<br/>
