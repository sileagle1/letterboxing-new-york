cousin came over and helped me figure out what I was doing wrong.  I needed to oil the thing.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, I was a member of the Thistledown handspinners over 30 years (Norwich, NY).  we<br/>
live in the Utica area now and I havent' had time to get involved with the local groups.  I would<br/>
how ever like to connect with the weaveing guild.  I was given a boonville loom last year and am<br/>
hoping to get it set up this week.<br/>
<br/>
speaking of man who knit - my father was taught as a young boy back in 1915ish to knit by his<br/>
mother,  he in turned showed my mom who of course taught me how. <br/>

<br/>
Ooo, ooo, you spin!?!?!?!?!?!?!  Hooray!  So do I, including spinning <br/>
fiber from my cute little angora bunny.  Which town are you in?  I <br/>
used to be in the Genesee Valley Handspinners Guild (meets in Victor <br/>
outside of Rochester) but since moving to Buffalo I have not found a <br/>
spinning guild here, just the weavers and an informal group that <br/>
meets at the shop out in Wheatfield that I went to once and haven't <br/>
managed to drag my butt back to yet.<br/>
<br/>
And Celtic Quinn knits?  Cool, you're quite a guy!  You would be the <br/>
second straight guy I've met who knits.  I've heard of more, but <br/>
they're hard to find as they tend to sort of hide and stay quiet <br/>
about it.  Apparently a lot of guys learned to knit socks in the <br/>
service during WWII, especially sailors.<br/>
<br/>
I am still thinking about my stamp to hide at a local spot for coffee <br/>
on Elmwood ave, but the Christmas prep has prevented me from doing <br/>
anything boxing related in quite a while.  I will be doing the family <br/>
dinner for the first time this year, and must prepare as much ahead <br/>
as possible this week.  Oh, and now that I've bought the presents, I <br/>
guess I have to wrap them before giving them out, huh?  Maybe this <br/>
afternoon if I can get off the computer.<br/>
<br/>
FIREBALL and I were talking about maybe combining cross country <br/>
skiing and boxing this winter.  I was going to hide my roundabout <br/>
series, but I don't think that's a very snow friendly location, so <br/>
maybe in the spring.<br/>

&gt; I must admit I have thought about letterboxing but then I look at <br/>
all that snow and .... well, need<br/>
&gt; i say more.  So I put away the letterboxing stuff and got out the <br/>
geneology, spinning and knitting<br/>
&gt; - until February that is. <br/>
