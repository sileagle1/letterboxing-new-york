Materials series out at Rice Creek. We've put it in a completely new <br/>
location and it has shortened the hike by a bit as well. Hopefully it <br/>
will do well in its new home. We also got back out to Riverside <br/>
Cemetery to rehide the Ghost of Seneca Hill. Unfortunately, her <br/>
original location was no longer an option. She's in a new spot, but <br/>
it's equally as scary! Plus her clues hook right up to WINK's box, <br/>
Here Lies Henry. Be sure to do them both on the same day.<br/>
<br/>
Well, better get back to my carving!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone's out 'boxing on a great day like today!<br/>
