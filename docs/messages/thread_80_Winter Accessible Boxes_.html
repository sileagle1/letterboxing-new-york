<br/>
MtnMan and I XC-skied the Lake Ontario Dune Trail this weekend and <br/>
I'm happy to say that these boxes are as winter accessible as we <br/>
planned them to be. (Though I omitted one box because I have <br/>
no reason to believe it isn't accessible because of the nature of its <br/>
hiding spot)<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion these boxes are a bit more strenuous to do in winter <br/>
since I'm a wussy skier! Do keep it in mind however if you are <br/>
expecting children to do it. So CNYers...if you need a Lb fix and <br/>
haven't done these pack a lunch and have at it! Feel free to email me <br/>
if you have any additional queries.<br/>
<br/>
Notes: There has been construction going on (they're building a new <br/>
gatehouse) but brochures are still available at the old gatehouse. <br/>
<br/>
Since the Park is closed up for winter there is no fee, no restrooms, <br/>
and no dog exclusion (Keep him leashed though! Dogs can get shot if <br/>
they're running deer!) <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm posting clues to LbNA &amp; AQ for two near-by Rt 81 drive-by <br/>
letterboxes! <br/>
