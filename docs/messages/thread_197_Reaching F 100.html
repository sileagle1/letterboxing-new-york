100 mark. They did a marathon session of my boxes in the Syracuse area <br/>
yesterday. Hit around 20 of them in a 12 hour session! Going back today <br/>
for a few more and to search again for a couple of attempted boxes. <br/>
<br/>
This is a fun way to seriously up your F-count..if you are into that <br/>
kind of thing. *grin*  I am more the slow but steady tortoise when it <br/>
comes to collecting my finds. lol<br/>
<br/>
Good luck you guys!<br/>
