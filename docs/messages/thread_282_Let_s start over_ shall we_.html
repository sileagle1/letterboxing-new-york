really not my decision to make. The original LBWNY group was just a <br/>
small group of folks who needed a place to post local events. We're <br/>
not anything near being as oragnized as this group is. This group (as <br/>
the larger one and the first one) really needs to make that decision. <br/>
My doing that with LBWNY doesn't really do anything but make life <br/>
more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, I'm starting over. I'm changing the name back to LBWNY <br/>
(so Paul can use the LBNY name if he'd like) and most likely closing <br/>
the group down. I think that'll make life easier on everyone <br/>
involved. If it's okay, I'd like to move the files we posted into the <br/>
files and photos here (since there's more than enough people from <br/>
both areas that have come to the gatherings our our way). Sorry for <br/>
all this confusion, folks...I think I've I just got sidetracked from <br/>
my original thing while trying to please everyone! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...back to my original point...(takes a moment to think as to <br/>
what that might have been)...oh, YEAH! I did have the shirt logo <br/>
changed over to say LBNY and Letterboxing New York State instead of <br/>
LBWNY and Western New York, so if you want one, you need to let us <br/>
know and pay at the gathering. See everyone soon...just a week away <br/>
now!</div>
