answers your question. I'll have to check him out some more... and the <br/>
World's End clues are a prime example of my wordy narrative clues -- I <br/>
actually trimmed that description down before I published it!<br/>
If you can, try to catch World End with some autumn color -- but it's <br/>
beautiful any season, and is great for cross-country skiing in winter, too!<br/>

carving for someone).<br/>

&gt; I lived in Boston for 19 years before moving here, San Francisco.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found "Head of the Charles" in Boston this past summer. Easy to find.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also while in Boston, I planted a box that's very special to me in <br/>
&gt; Hingham,<br/>
&gt; south of Boston. It's called, "World Without End: World's End". Here's the<br/>
&gt; link: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/worlds%20end.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/worlds%20end.htm</a><br/>
&gt; If you head in that direction, I'd recommend it due to its beautiful<br/>
&gt; location.<br/>

&gt;&gt; By any chance have you done the Battle of Bunker Hill box?  We were<br/>
&gt;&gt; out that way a few weekends ago but weren't able to locate it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hey there ... I don't live in Central NY (live in Boston now), but I<br/>
&gt;&gt; thought I'd stop in and say hello anyway!  I grew up in the Finger<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lakes (just north of Canandaigua) and have a ton of great ideas for<br/>
&gt;&gt; boxes back there, but haven't been able to put any together yet.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was a little worried that the more 'boxers from central and western<br/>
&gt;&gt; NY came along, the more likely I was to lose the spots I'm thinking<br/>
&gt;&gt; of to one of you, but that's OK.  I look at it this way now -- as I<br/>
&gt;&gt; won't be able to care for the boxes, I've got a lot of potential<br/>
&gt;&gt; babysitters!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, best of luck with the group!<br/>
