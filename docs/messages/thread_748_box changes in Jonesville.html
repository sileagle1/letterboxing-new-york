Message: <br/>
They're doing some construction near my parents' house near Jonesville, NY. Can <br/>
you let the group know if they have a letterbox near a playground on Longkill <br/>
Road called "Snap out of it", or something like that, they had to move it 20 <br/>
feet or so, because the trees it was under are being removed to widen a path.<br/>
