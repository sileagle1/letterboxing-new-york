which means food, fun and BOXING! We're going to have a little mini-meet at<br/>
the Sprilander HH Hostel on July 24th from about noon to 4pm or so. Bring<br/>
food and we'll make hotdogs and stuff (plus you can trade out some of the<br/>
HH's in the hostel and plant them around WNY for us). Needless to say,<br/>
there's a few boxes in the area, too and we WILL have an event stamp (once I<br/>
think of a nifty name for the event)! Contact us offlist if you'd like to<br/>
meet and greet with our long lost boxing buddies!<br/>
