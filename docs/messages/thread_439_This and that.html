aren't TOTALLY stopped by snow, are we? I am happy to report that <br/>
I've seen some new plants in the Syracuse area (Try Budgie's I.M. <br/>
Pei's Box, for example) and there has been an date change for the <br/>
Finger Lakes Gathering in June. I highly recommend this gathering!<br/>
<br/>
The plans for Desperately Seeking Sun are chugging right along. <br/>
Donated boxes are trickling in, as well as some cool raffle prizes. <br/>
Let us be your re-gifting headquarters! Absolutely hate that scarf <br/>
Aunt Millie knit for you? Send it in! End up with more #1 blades than <br/>
you can use? We'll take 'em! Think someone else would enjoy a pair of <br/>
your favorite hiking socks? We agree! Contact me by email<br/>
(<a href="mailto:lockwench@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lockwench@...</a>) and I'll let you know how to get them to us.<br/>
<br/>
There are all sorts of unique boxes for this event, with some carved <br/>
by premiere boxers from all over the country, so please try to join <br/>
us. Some are truly unique or twisted.....muah ha ha!  We have <br/>
a "Chocolate Game" for the kids with a special prize and awesome <br/>
Basket Raffles including a Finder's Basket, a Planter's Basket, a <br/>
Carver's Basket, a Mini-box Basket and an I Love New York basket. For <br/>
those of you who are coming in from out of town..this time is also <br/>
Syracuse's Winterfest, with all sorts of cool events if you can stay <br/>
for the entire weekend. Did I mention that there will be people <br/>
crawling all over local parks looking for the special Winterfest <br/>
Medallion (worth $1,000)?  We now have a perfect cover <br/>
story....."We're looking for the Medallion!"<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget our Desperately Seeking Suds event. This event is <br/>
not only for those who attend Sun, but for anyone who wants to meet <br/>
up with us at Kelley's Restaurant and Irish Pub. This will be the <br/>
Mecca of Traveling Event stamps, as well as a chance to pick up those <br/>
personal stamps you might have missed. There will be an event stamp <br/>
as well as a permanent stamp hidden at Kelley's called "Last Call." <br/>
We have our own room and you don't have to eat or drink to come join <br/>
us. Just show up! Although anyone who is interested in having dinner <br/>
should rsvp on Atlasquest or send me a note so that we have an <br/>
approximate head count.<br/>
<br/>
The official countdown starts February 1st. I hope we'll pull some of <br/>
you out of your winter hibernation.<br/>
