handily...or is that just in box proliferation??? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our names are pretty simple (and sadly sentimental). The <br/>
Highlander and I actually met in a MUD game called Terris where we <br/>
were playing (aptly enough) a Highland warrior and a half dark elven <br/>
sprite. Our friendship blossomed online, then onto the phone lines <br/>
and then in person...the rest is history. Even now before we go to <br/>
bed, we still say "Sweet dreams my little sprite" and "sweet dreams, <br/>
my big Highland hero" to each other, just like we used to over the <br/>
phone. <br/>
<br/>
And anyone who gives him grief for bending to his wife's sappy will <br/>
gets to deal with the violent tomboy side of me in retribution! (does <br/>
a quick flash of evil glare not unlike Bilbo's scary transformation <br/>
in Lord of the Rings before smiling sweetly at everyone with a little <br/>
happy flutter of wings). So there!<br/>

The (bipolar) Sprite &amp; the (never showing his face in public again) <br/>
Highlander<br/>

</span></blockquote>My trail name is my Netscape identity, and a perfect fit.  The stamp was easy, we had a <br/>
crazy cat (Edward) full of personality who lived to the ripe age of 18, in spite of numerous <br/>
health problems, and was happy up until the end.  He was long and lean with with looong <br/>
silky fur and a huge plume of a tail.  Edward loved making an entrance strutting into the <br/>
room, his tail feathers fluffed out to their fullest.  We'd see the plume go by and a few <br/>
minutes later it'd go by again...but we'd never see him leave the room, only enter.  He <br/>
loved tuna (or any seafood catfood) so whenever it was served all we had to call out was <br/>
"arrrr" and he'd come running.  And the cat had a smile on his face.  The image on my <br/>
stamp is Edward running to the call of "arrrr" inside a waivering line circle "bead".<br/>
<br/>
We have a small team stamp that I made once when we were out of town and forgot to put <br/>
our boxing stuff in the car in our rush to leave, luckily I had the clues to the boxes packed <br/>
with the laptop.  So I made a small stamp that combined both our trail names from <br/>
supplies we picked up at a local art store.  We now use this stamp for small logbooks, and <br/>
when we go on a hike without planning on doing any letterboxing.    <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
