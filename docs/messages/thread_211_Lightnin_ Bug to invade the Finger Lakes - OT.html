"bug away" type of repellant - one that contains only essential oils  and alcohol - in a pump spray<br/>
bottle.  Works wonderfully on mosquitoes, black flies and deer flies (as well as other pesky little<br/>
bugs, gnats etc).  What makes these types of sprays nice is they don't contain deet and aren't<br/>
smelly and sticky like conventional ones.  hence no need to wash off body before retiring for the<br/>
evening.  Have a good LBing weekend. <br/>

Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My lovely non-LB wife and I will be invading the Finger Lakes for the <br/>
Wine Festival this weekend, although I've had a bit of a 'non-<br/>
letterboxing' moratorium placed upon me due to Sharon getting <br/>
skeetered badly (~20 bites in like 5 minutes) last year in the FLNF. </span></blockquote></div>
