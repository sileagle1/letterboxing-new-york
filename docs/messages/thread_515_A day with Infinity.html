<br/>
I got up this morning and ran some errands with my wife.  I asked<br/>
her if she wanted to play "hooky" and go letterboxing, but she<br/>
couldn't.  I, on the other hand, did.  I headed up to capture<br/>
Yankeechiks's new boxes.  Soo..........  I get to one of the new<br/>
ones, and what is sitting on the location of the box?!!???!!<br/>
Several construction workers, ....and folks....they weren't moving.<br/>
AT ALL!  So I waited...and waited...and....yup....waited.  They<br/>
said "hello" and smiled back.  OH!.....and I waited.  I pretended to<br/>
watch the crane lift crap.  I made fake phone calls. I then, after<br/>
2+ hours....gave up.  I had driven an hour to claim nothing.  I<br/>
called Craftymouse with my frustrations and story.  I needed to save<br/>
the box, and would have to come back again.  *shrug*  Oh well, it<br/>
was a cool place, and I'd bring the camera that I forgot in the car<br/>
next time.  Well in my conversation with CM, she noted that Infinity<br/>
had mentioned that she was going to be headed up this way. I didn't<br/>
want the same thing happening to her, as me.  I called her. We<br/>
decided to meet at the Salmon Falls box for an "exchange".<br/>
<br/>
I pulled into the lot, and met the F-man.  The gentleman used the F<br/>
word a BUNCH.  EVEN MORE THAN I DO!!!  He seemed to use it as a<br/>
noun, adjective, verb....all kinds of cool ways.  I quickly grabbed<br/>
the camera and headed down the trail.  DING!  There she was.  we<br/>
introduced ourselves and proceeded to box away.  After<br/>
getting "Naked Trees" done, we decided to "capture" the FF certs for<br/>
all the 3 new boxes that Yankeechik put out.  Yes, we (I) went back<br/>
north to the construction site after dropping my car off in<br/>
Pulaski.  She drives as fast as me :)  It was nice to see other<br/>
80+'ers out there. ANYHOW....  WE GOT IT!!  Nice stamp, no workers,<br/>
and got some cool photos.  If I can ever figure this new camera out,<br/>
I'll post'em.<br/>
<br/>
Along the way Infinity obtained "coming" and "Deep in the heart<br/>
of....".  We shared some funny stories, and had an outstanding day.<br/>
Thanks to all of you ladies for helping make it possible.<br/>
Craftymouse for the info (call), Infinity for hang'n with a short<br/>
fat guy for 5 hours (not an easy task, ask 'Mouse), and Yankeechik<br/>
for the box!!  Thanks ladies :) :) :)<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day.</div>
