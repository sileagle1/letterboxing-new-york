<br/>
Nice to see boxing in CNY finally taking off. <br/>
<br/>
I own homes in Central and Northern NY respectively, but work in CT. <br/>
My reason for being here is that I was born and raised in Syracuse, <br/>
have family and friends there still, and try to spend as much time as <br/>
possible in the area in spite of an over-busy career.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that with some connections and not a little <br/>
politicking I've gotten permission to place letterboxes from folks at <br/>
several very juicy places in the CNY area. As some of you know, my <br/>
boxes/clues are WOM unless they are part of another boxer's series <br/>
that is published. I won't be getting these new boxes hidden until <br/>
Spring, but when I do, as in the past, I'll likely drop a hint or <br/>
two "somewhere." <br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
