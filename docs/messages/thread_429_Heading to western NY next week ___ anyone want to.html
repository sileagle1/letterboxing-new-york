<br/>
I'll be headed home to western NY (Canandiagua / Rochester) next week<br/>
for the Christmas holiday.  If anyone in the area wants to connect,<br/>
let me know !  I'll be doing some boxing during the days, probably<br/>
mostly in the Rochester area, but some too near where I grew up in<br/>
Canandaigua, although there's not many boxes there.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to plant a few boxes while I was out there, but I never<br/>
got the stamps carved.  I have one box that I will plant however,<br/>
although the clues won't be posted until January 3.<br/>
<br/>
