the opening paragraphs of the clues with LbCNY, as I'm sure you all <br/>
need to seek help. The box is called "The Therapeutist". Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
You're a letterboxer. You sneak around, avoiding the public's <br/>
attention. You don't use your real name. You have a fetish for <br/>
Rubbermaid products. You play with pink stuff and sharp objects. One <br/>
minute you're Dirty Harry, the next minute you're Nancy Drew. You <br/>
exhibit obsessive-compulsive behavior, and your head throbs from <br/>
pondering cryptic instructions. <br/>
<br/>
You need help. Seek the Therapeutist. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not so sure, though, that Magritte, the surrealist <br/>
painter's "Therapeutist" will cure you. Face it. You're beyond help. <br/>
But maybe this surreal letterbox will make reality seem closer to <br/>
the reality that non-letterboxers experience. <br/>
<br/>
No appointment is necessary. Drop-ins are welcome. <br/>
<br/>
So if you come to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in <br/>
your hair, and see the Therapeutist.<br/>
