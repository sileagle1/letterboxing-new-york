 BuggyLou has been renamed Nanuck of the North. She was pumping gas and eating an ice cream cone!! Seriously though, she did a great job driving our group through the snow onSaturday. Sunday we arrived home safe and sound around 8:30pm. MinPin Lovers</html></div>

told you we were fine and on our way, we broke down on the thruway.  <br/>
We were towed back to Buffalo.  It was the driver's second longest tow.<br/>

There's more info on the Atlas Quest message board at AQ, as well as <br/>
pictures of my honey's car in a ditch.<br/>
