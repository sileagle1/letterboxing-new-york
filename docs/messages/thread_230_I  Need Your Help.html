                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-116582679">Hi all. I am asking help from all CNY letterboxers to test an area <br/>
that we are considering for the new location of the "I Love NY <br/>
Hitchhiker Hostel." While I do enjoy finding hitchhikers "in the <br/>
wild" most of all.....this is a way for people who are coming through <br/>
NYS to share their HH's with us. A great way to get your own HH's all <br/>
over the country as well. <br/>
<br/>
The location is the same as the one I have used for my newest <br/>
box...."All Natural." Many thanks to WINK who suggested this <br/>
location. If any of you are coming from 81 South, 81 North, the <br/>
Thruway or 690...you will find this an easy box to get to...with few <br/>
turns and not far off any of these roads.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have time to test this site for us, please let me know. <br/>
You can find the clues on atlasquest under "All Natural."  If you <br/>
prefer, I can send you the clues. Just to let you know, "All Natural" <br/>
is located less than a few miles from Clark Reservation and Route 173 <br/>
(Seneca Turnpike) which is the gateway to many boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!</div>
