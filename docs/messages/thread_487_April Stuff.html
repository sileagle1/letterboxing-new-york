                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-805484446">OK..time to get back out there and do maintenance! Change those <br/>
logbooks, rebag, rehide boxes better...replace missing boxes. I've been <br/>
busily recarving some of my first stamps...as those boxes were the ones <br/>
who went missing most often. My count dropped by about 6 as I <br/>
eliminated boxes that I was sick of replacing...because their original <br/>
hiding areas were so non-condusive to boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Then comes the film festival..so I will be busy entertaining directors <br/>
and actors from all over the world. Truly my most favorite part of the <br/>
festival. <br/>
<br/>
THEN..back to boxing and getting out there!! My one year anniversary is <br/>
coming up and I am shooting for a personal best. Any of you have <br/>
specific goals for this year? <br/>

for me with my schedule and other "stuff", but I<br/>
really miss going boxing.  And I want to carve and<br/>
plant more stuff around Binghamton so y'all will have<br/>
a reason to come down and check out the Southern<br/>
Tier!!!<br/>
