<div>I am feeling so discouraged! Each of the three series I have planted have been sabotaged.  Last night Clifford and I went to the CCC Nature Trail to pick up the last "box" of "Lucy and Clifford's Wildlife Adventures."  I knew it needed some glue, and since I am FINALLY on vacation I decided this would be a good time to do it. Well we went in and found the last box smashed to pieces and wedged into a tree. :o(  The logbook and stamp were nowhere to be found.  I went back today to look in the light (it was dusk when I went last night) and I searched the brush, trees, EVERYWHERE for it. Gone! And the stamp was one of my favorites too... a caricature of me, Lucy, and Clifford in our van driving home... it took forever to sketch and then carve. Gone! And the last "box" was actually a birdhouse I had taken the time to paint, camoflauge, and paint a note in the inside door and polyeurathane... smashed to pieces!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first series at the remote Bear Swamp State Forest--the second box disappeared within a week of planting it. Historic Auburn... second box tossed in a creek within two months of planting it... and now Lucy and Clifford's Wildlife Adventures-- the box smashed to pieces and logbook and stamp gone. :o( And only the first and last of this series had logbooks because the rest were microboxes, so now I have lost all the stamps and comments. :o(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sorry about venting. I am just so discouraged about planting letterboxes right now. You put so much money, and then  time into the carving, and then the box, and then planting it and coming up with the clues... and whoosh! They disappear or are abused and tossed! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think I will go have a big bowl of ice cream right now to nurse my sorrows *sniff*.</div>

used up all the vandals' energy, and they're back hanging around the<br/>
mall, complaining about having nothing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I've had only one box torn apart, and since I wasn't the one who<br/>
picked up the bits, it didn't hit me very hard.  <br/>
<br/>
How's your Lucy doing?  I hope she is on the mend!<br/>

<div>This is the place to vent. That is so crummy. I've never had one vandalized, but some have gone missing along the way. I try to tell myself that they are just things, and be all mature and everything, but ..............grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I hope you can get passed it and keep planting boxes. </div>
