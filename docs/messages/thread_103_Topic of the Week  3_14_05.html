working on the clues and boxes so that we can place them the next <br/>
time we are back that way.<br/>
<br/>
We're also working on a local box to plant here in IN. So far we <br/>
think we'll be making our own logbooks that way we can control the <br/>
size of them.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say I LOVE carving the stamps and I think once we get <br/>
started planting boxes we're going to have to keep going just so I <br/>
can keep carving. LOL<br/>

</span></blockquote>YES! Don't think no one is listening! I'm grateful Catbead you <br/>
keep this list going with your posts and Topics of the Week. Thank <br/>
you, thank you, thank you! Ditto to those others of you that <br/>
contribute too! It IS selfish of me to enjoy reading the posts <br/>
without doing my share to keep the list active. Sorry, :(  I'll try a <br/>
little more effort.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What's your favorite carving medium?  <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>PZ KUT! And you're right about their customer service...&gt;&gt;And what <br/>
other company can you buy from on Monday and have your product 2 days <br/>
later without paying an arm and a kidney&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd like to try the mastercarve because its thicker but I'm <br/>
too cheap, its not available near me, and well...the PZ KUT works <br/>
just fine! I followed Catbead's lead and now add a layer of fun foam <br/>
to make it easier to stamp with. (BTW Catbead, I learned the hard way <br/>
about using goop as the adhesive! After your original post last year <br/>
I realized that was what made my stamp warp too. I managed to peel it <br/>
off and reglue using the Ultra Stix All to salvaged it.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you make your own logbooks to tuck into your boxes?<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Ah...logbooks! Now there's something closer to my heart, I love <br/>
making logbooks! Fat ones, folded ones, sewn ones, and tiny ones too! <br/>
Made to fit the box! Yup, and they're all just sittin here collecting <br/>
dust! Because, I DO NOT like the writing clues and finding hiding <br/>
places part! Procrastinator is Me! :(<br/>

PRESENT (raising hand....)<br/>
<br/>
I don't know that I've carved enough to have a favorite carving medium, but I have used Speedball and PZ Cut.  Of the two, I think I like the PZ Cut better, because it doesn't need a backing.  <br/>
<br/>
I need to send a LONG overdue THANK YOU to catbead, who donated the PZ Cut kit to the WNY Gathering last Nov.  I won that kit, and otherwise probably never would have tried PZ Cut.  THANKS, CATBEAD! <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing,<br/>
