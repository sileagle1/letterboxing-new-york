major holiday weekends!It's called The Coffee Stop!<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to be travelling up I-81 over the weekend, stop in at<br/>
the <br/>
Coffee Stop set up at the rest stop between Mannsville(exit 39)and <br/>
Pierrepont Manor(exit 40). Check out the generator powering the <br/>
operation and look behind the big black toolbox(on the woods side)and <br/>
you will see the letterbox sitting there wrapped in a black bag. Most <br/>
of the volunteers are accustom to the occasional interest in the <br/>
generator (and fire truck), so pretend to have some! The volunteers<br/>
do <br/>
not know about the letterbox, but MtnMan (Mick) does and he runs the <br/>
coffee stop! <br/>
<br/>
Clues to this letterbox will be posted on LbNA later this weekend! I <br/>
had to wait until the coffee stop was set up to know where to place<br/>
the <br/>
box so it would be in the same place no matter which side the coffee <br/>
stop was on. Consider these the clues until then! <br/>
<br/>
There is another letterbox in each of these rest stops, see Coming<br/>
and <br/>
Going! Have a safe weekend!<br/>
