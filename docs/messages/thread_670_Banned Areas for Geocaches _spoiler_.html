Geocaching is currently banned in National Parks and National Wildlife<br/>
Refuges. This includes the Appalachian Trail. It is a National Park,<br/>
therefore caches may not be placed on or in close proximity to it.<br/>
<br/>
New York State Parks: Caches may be placed on State Parks managed by<br/>
New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.<br/>
A geocaching permit is required and may be obtained from the park<br/>
office.  Please indicate your permit number on the cache page.<br/>
<br/>
New York State Wildlife Management Areas: All off limits to geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
We have been asked by New York State DEC to NOT place caches on<br/>
mountain tops or right at the overlooks.  Please keep caches below the<br/>
tree line.  All caches MUST be marked GEOCACHE.<br/>
<br/>
No caches may be place in the Western High Peaks region (zone B) or<br/>
the Eastern High Peaks region (zone C).  Both high peaks regions may<br/>
be identified on a DEC map at <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/33889.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/33889.html</a><br/>
