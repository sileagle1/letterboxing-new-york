<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This rules! Out of respect, I think after I've 
talked with people at the gathering, I'll be closed down LBWNY so that we don't 
have to bounce from board to board anymore. We always posted our gatherings in 
all places nearby including CNY, so that won't change, but I'll also be moving 
our pics and such to the new board ASAP. </font></div>

that stays up late and has unlimited energy, check out the ever ready Celtic 
Quinn! He moderated for LBWNY while I was teaching school and was great tech 
support besides! ;-)</font></div>
