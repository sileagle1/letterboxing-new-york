Feathers Ruffled" and "Fine Feathered Friend" in Utica and New Hartford <br/>
respectively. They're both posted on both atlasquest.com and <br/>
letterboxing.org as are the others I've recently planted.<br/>
<br/>
You'll see that there's a whole series on the theme of feathers now <br/>
scattered around the Mohawk Valley and the foothills of the <br/>
Adirondacks. Catch 'em and collect 'em!<br/>
<br/>
My niece, her friend, and families (a.k.a. MisDeesCrew) have also <br/>
planted several really nice boxes right here around Oriskany.<br/>
<br/>
I hope they keep you busy for a while!<br/>
