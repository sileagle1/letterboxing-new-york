<br/>
Just letting you know that my travelling stamp, the "Screaming Pink <br/>
Mingos" will be migrating to Western NY for the week of July 14th - <br/>
20th.  Clue is updated and posted on AQ, so feel free to stop by and <br/>
pick it up if you're in the area!<br/>
<br/>
I don't normally announce my boxes this way, but I'm not sure how to <br/>
register it as a "new" box on AQ since it's been around for a year <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some of you this coming week!<br/>
