</span></blockquote>Well, there was no slapping involved, but I was spotted by LOSTGIRL <br/>
fairly early on. I guess I confused some by wearing my hair up. But <br/>
Jackbear certainly was in heaven. Attendence at this convention was <br/>
about 200 to 1, in terms of females versus males.  The event stamp <br/>
commemorated this....with an image of 5 women in bikinis surrounding <br/>
a male and...  Well, I think I'll make this one a personal traveler <br/>
or something....too cute to leave in a drawer.  When I arrived just <br/>
before the door opened, there were about 200 people in line already. <br/>
While chatting with many in line, I learned that the majority were <br/>
scrapbookers, with rubber stamp card makers making up the rest. I met <br/>
no other letterboxers, but many were intrigued by the idea. I gave <br/>
out the website addresses to maybe 3 or 4 people. <br/>
<br/>
It was a really nice group though..about 8 of us. We commandered a <br/>
large circular table and passed stamps around. I got a chance to give <br/>
Craftymouse the Desperately Seeking Suds stamp that she missed on the <br/>
night of Knitica's car crash. I cheated and piggybacked on Jackbear's <br/>
responses to get Craftymouse's personal travelers. Awesome stamps and <br/>
presentation.  My Ex-in-Box was let out for a little air too.  Wyvern <br/>
carved a cool new signature stamp for LOSTGIRL...be sure to do an <br/>
exchange with her. So clever....  We had a newbie in our midst and I <br/>
am hoping that this smaller and friendly group tricked, I <br/>
mean "convinced" her that we're all relatively sane. *grin*   We also <br/>
had a rather striking young couple walk up to us and ask us if we <br/>
were letterboxers. We happily replied yes and they said they were <br/>
letterboxers in the Ithaca area. They gave us their names, and when <br/>
we asked what their LB names were, they said they had stamps but no <br/>
names yet. Hm... I wish I had remembered to invite them to the Ithaca <br/>
gathering!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, we bought cool inkpads and lots of neat paper and other <br/>
stuff. I passed on the comb binding logbook making machine but was <br/>
informed by Maiden1974 that there are similar, much cheaper machines <br/>
on ebay for about $25. I looked for a commericial stamp maker but no <br/>
such luck. <br/>
<br/>
We had plenty of time to talk and make eye contact, etc...which made <br/>
for a very pleasant time. I kept thinking of my friends up in Mass, <br/>
meeting for the next day's  Ice Cream Social with over 125 people <br/>
signed up. I dunno, but I am thinking we had the much better time....<br/>
<br/>
Missing you, Lisa......much love to you and Robb.<br/>
