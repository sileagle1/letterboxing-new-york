actually start searching for letterboxes until May of this year. We <br/>
are loving it. We're back home in Rome for Thanksgiving and stopped <br/>
to hunt up a few on the way in. <br/>
  Thanks to whoever posted about the orange vests. I never gave it a <br/>
thought about wearing them this time of year. Went to Walmart and <br/>
picked up a few cheapies and will carry those with us now.<br/>
  Wishing the weather was nicer had a few more boxes we wanted to <br/>
search for. Oh Well There's always the next trip.<br/>

<br/>
I also apologize for posting infrequently while reading everyone else's<br/>
messages, and I second the "Thank you Catbead!!!" for keeping this list<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
We've carved a lot of our stamps out of the Mastercarve stuff.  I've<br/>
never been in a store that sells PZ cut so I don't know what it is.<br/>
I've heard people mention "the pink stuff" and I don't know what that<br/>
is, either.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite thing to do is carve on fun erasers.  I bought a ton of them<br/>
at Office Max after the "Back to School" hoopla was over.  I have round,<br/>
smiley ones that I like to carve, and also they had ones that look like<br/>
coins.  They make the best hitchhikers.  I really enjoy finding a stamp<br/>
that someone made out of something unusual.<br/>
<br/>
As far as logbooks go, that's an area I need to work on.  I can sit and<br/>
carve anywhere, but my craft area at home is just a mess, so it's a real<br/>
challenge to move stuff, find what I need, clear a space, and be<br/>
inspired to create wonderful logbooks.  I tend to run spiral notebooks<br/>
through a bandsaw and get on with my life.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully my logbook endeavors will improve....... :)<br/>
