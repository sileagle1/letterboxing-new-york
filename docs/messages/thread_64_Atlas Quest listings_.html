know a lot of folks who do just LBNA, but we've found it works to our <br/>
advantage to post at both, using LBNA as the original post, but <br/>
linking to that URL on Atlas Quest to save the trouble of retyping. <br/>
Seems to help folks find boxes that are nearby really easily...in <br/>
fact, all the WNY Gathering boxes were posted there, so people could <br/>
find the Gathering boxes, plus the permanent boxes without much <br/>
hassle (if they wanted to). It drove me NUTS that we were right NEXT <br/>
to some of the boxes at the MMM, but didn't realize it because we <br/>
weren't as familiar with the area.<br/>
<br/>
It's also kinda fun seeing who's new in town when they post their <br/>
finds and now that you can sign up for postal boxes, it's even MORE <br/>
fun. Anyway, just wondered...is anybody else doing this, or is this <br/>
just a WNY thing?<br/>
