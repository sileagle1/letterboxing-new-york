of 81).  I got smart and started saving my stamp drawings so I could <br/>
duplicate a stamp easily. But it's true that once the journal is <br/>
gone.....<br/>
<br/>
My worst one was a little wooden suitcase that I had painted and <br/>
lined with maps and put travel stickers all over the outside. I had <br/>
hoisted it high into a tree and tied off the string around a nail <br/>
embeded in an old tree. Well I didn't choose the place wisely as it <br/>
turned out to have a LOT of kid traffic. They took the box but <br/>
luckily  dumped the stamp and journal so I got those back. sigh<br/>
<br/>
My box at Thornden (up near SU) is always going missing too. I will <br/>
probably have to retire that one as I am tired of replacing the <br/>
journal. I am getting better I think at placing boxes as it's mostly <br/>
my FIRST placed boxes that disappear. I avoid busy parks and stick to <br/>
ones with not as much foot traffic. I avoid playgrounds or ball <br/>
fields like the plague! And I try to place so that a spur trail will <br/>
not be formed and lead muggles RIGHT TO MY BOX. Camoflage tape has <br/>
helped too. <br/>
<br/>
Don't give up as you are an EXCELLENT carver and I have really <br/>
enjoyed your stamps. Take a break and regroup and go over your hiding <br/>
places. I personally LOVED the last box in the Clifford and Lucy <br/>
series but I did wonder if it was going to be vandalized as it was <br/>
rather in the open. Ah well. A pity there are always going to be <br/>
jerks out there that will ruin anything pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
So tell us..how is Lucy?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1884569686">Good advice; avoid busy areas. It breaks my heart when I can't find a <br/>
box, and the previous boxer also marked it "attempted," and it is <br/>
obvious where it should have been hidden, so I know it is gone, and I <br/>
try to figure out why? <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there is no good reason, in which case I blame the racoons. <br/>
