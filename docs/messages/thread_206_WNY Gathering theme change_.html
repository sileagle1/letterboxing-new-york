Actually, I recently realized I had gotten my "Just Get Out There and <br/>
Play" theme from having heard Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's "Just Get Out There <br/>
and Box" theme some time ago (which they have REALLY cool looking <br/>
wristbands for that you'll all be able to purchase at the <br/>
gathering!). I apologized profusely to him a few weeks ago, but he <br/>
was totally cool with our using that theme.<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm thinking other folks might not be as understanding of <br/>
what looks like a blatant ripoff. Plus, I like to think of myself as <br/>
a creative individual without the guilt of piggybacking (intentional <br/>
or not), so I changed the theme to "Just Playin' Around WNY" instead. <br/>
Still the same type of boxes, now with 100% less guilt and shame <br/>
free! :-)<br/>
<br/>
We've got nearly 50 folks planning on stopping by in August, with a <br/>
god 25 boxes in the park and even more close by...have you signed up <br/>
yet???<br/>

</span></blockquote>People don't care :)  We understand that there was no "swipe" of <br/>
themes.  We started with that idea, and it was fresh and clean, and <br/>
we should stay with it.  Boxing is a tight group that worries not of <br/>
small insignificant things such as trivial closeness of thoughts.  <br/>
That is what makes us great.  Truly.  <br/>
We grow, as a group, on the ability to "steal" good <br/>
ideas/thoughts/themes.  This is what keeps our game solid.  We need <br/>
no worries what the other person thinks, just the glamour of an <br/>
original thought being rethought without the knowledge of being <br/>
brought up first.  It is all good, just restated later.<br/>

SOMEONE cares, even if Mark and Sue don't mind (they do have a <br/>
trademark on the slogan for their bands). Plus, I think a secret part <br/>
of me wants to feel as independently creative as I can (I mean, what <br/>
kind of gifted and talented teacher can't come up with her own <br/>
gathering name???)! lol I just feel better having clear title to <br/>
something that I'm involving all of you in. Anyway, it's just the <br/>
theme that's changing words slightly, so nothing's really lost here.<br/>
<br/>
Much credit to Mark and Sue for coming up with something so catchy <br/>
that it stuck in my head without my knowing where it had come <br/>
from...I can't wait to get one of those wristbands! We'll be raffling <br/>
a few off at the gathering, too, so we'll still have something <br/>
related to the original idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support, though, WINK...I did feel some guilt there! <br/>
