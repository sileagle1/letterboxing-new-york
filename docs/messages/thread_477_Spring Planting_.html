                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1250321409">Hmm.."spring planting" means one thing to my gardening sister, but <br/>
quite another thing to me. It's time to begin planting the boxes I've <br/>
created and nurtured over the long cold winter.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, weather permitting, I am heading to the Cortland/Sempronius <br/>
area. I'd like to find Trailhoundz's Bear Swamp boxes and plant one <br/>
there myself..plus a few more in other nearby areas.<br/>
<br/>
By far, the most boxes I have ready to go are for the southern and <br/>
central Adirondacks. The High Peaks  region is  beautiful and I really <br/>
enjoyed them in the past, but they are getting just too overrun with <br/>
tourists now for me to enjoy them as much. There are so many other <br/>
gorgeous areas of the Adirondacks..with cool swimming holes, beautiful <br/>
waterfalls and interesting caves and abandoned mines. Stay tuned! :)<br/>

<br/>
I have several PLBs that have come home and are awaiting a permanent <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to plant fairly close to home, but the ones that were <br/>
closest to us are the ones that are missing now.<br/>
<br/>
I have seven Harry Potter LBs I'd like to plant in a series, but I'm <br/>
not sure where to put them....I still drive around with "Thankful for <br/>
Happiness" (from a WNY gathering in 2004) in the van because he never <br/>
found the right home, either.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I just have serious separation issues......<br/>
Maybe I'll just plant everything in our woods and you guys can all <br/>
visit me and find them!  Now those would definitely have to be WOM <br/>
clues!<br/>

<div>Yeah!!!!!!! Adirondack boxes!!!! And... I see you planted one in Auburn, Lockwench! Woo hoo... an Auburn box not planted by moi... I'm so excited and I hope it stops raining soon so I can find it.  ;oD</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have several boxes ready for spring...   3 additional boxes for the Historic Auburn series.... 4 boxes for Howland Island in Port Byron... a "Lucy" series for Green Lakes... and Artichoke and I are planning a 10 box series down near Ithaca/Watkins Glen. I also re-carved all my missing/vandalized stamps and boxes (I told myself this winter... you CANNOT carve any more stamps until you take care of the missing ones, LOL!). :o) </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm also probably going to do another Adirondack stamp or two (I planted my first at Eagle's Nest Lake near Inlet, if anyone is thinking of spring camping!)... and since Lucy is getting her own series at Green Lakes, Clifford wants a series too, but he may have to wait till I order more Pink rubber stuff.  I agree with you Lockwench about the high peaks region... I love the Long Lake/Inlet area... and I am DYING to visit the Adirondack "Ghost Town" of Tawahus... the pictures I found online look absolutely, wonderfully creepy, hee hee. ;o)  It deserves a stamp... I can't wait to visit (with dogs and pink speedball in hand, of course!). :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'd love to do a Wells College series (I'm an alum, and also work there) but that also depends on how much $$ is left in my rainy day fund to buy more rubber, Lock n-Locks, etc.... ah, if only dollars grew on trees....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh yes... If the weather is good this weekend, I will start replanting all my boxes I pulled up over the winter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, I think that's it for my planting news... except for my OTHER planting news, which will be a garden that contains rasberries (red and black), strawberries, lettuce, cucumbers, peppers, various herbs, and I am going to attempt asperagus this year too!  And this year I will plant my garden OUTSIDE the fenced yard, so it doesn't become Clifford's favorite lift-my-leg-pee-pee area, like it did last year. Naughty, naughty dog!  :o(</div>

I just went and found one up at OCC that had been planted by J.A.P. and Seekher. I was surprised that I was only the second finder even though the box had been there almost a month!</div> <div> </div> <div>Now I am glad I asked where you were planting, because I had planned one for Howland Island. Hadn't carved it yet, so I will look elsewhere. Four sounds like a good enough number for that place. I didn't make it to Bear Swamp as the rain was just pouring too much, but I will get mine there eventually. With 3,000 acres, it's not likely to get too crowded. I did manage to plant a couple at Lime Hollow, just south of Cortand, but the 2 boxes I have for Fillmore Glen will have to wait for a drier day.</div> <div> </div> <div>I've been to Tahawus and agree it would be a great place for a box. I thought one was there already, but I may be mistaken. My favorite Adirondack area is the
 Siamese Pond Wilderness...especially Chimney Mt with it's rock climbers and cool caves. I've got probably 15 boxes sitting here for the Adirondacks, so get ready!</div> <div> </div> <div>I know what you mean about replacing the missing ones. I've been slowly replacing mine as well. Slowly, because I am rethinking a couple of them. But it's my personal goal to never have more than 5% of my boxes missing at any given time. I think that's a decent goal.</div> <div> </div> <div>I enjoyed the article about Wells and Pleasant Rowland, although I think the townspeople protest too much. I would be happy to have a millionaire take care of my town and insure it's financial success and beauty. She could be as picky as she wanted!  I would love to do your Wells series and I still have to replant my Honeymoon box down that way.</div> <div> </div> <div>Btw, I stopped into a dollar store in Cortland and was pleased to find those big rubber erasers..the flat, rectangular
 ones with "For BIG Mistakes" written on the sides. Someone had posted that they really liked using these so I thought I would give them a try. They certainly were reasonable.....$1 for an eraser about 7 inches long and almost 2 inches wide..and about 3/8 inches thick. I'll let you know how they are.  I really am unhappy with the orange PZ Cut and wish they would switch back to the white stuff. The pink stuff is great but just so darn expensive.....</div> <div> </div> <div>Lock Wench<br/><br/><b><i>Jen Z &lt;jenzstudio@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1884872101replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div>Yeah!!!!!!!

<div>Hi Lockwench-- That's fine with me if you want to plant some stamps at Howland Island too... the more the merrier, and the more stamps there the more people might come out to Cayuga County and enjoy the Island! :o) It's a pretty huge area and there are 5-7 miles of trails. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ah, the Adirondacks... There is a stamp at Tawahus... not sure where in town it is though. Apparently there are several blast furnaces.  I have never been to the Indian Lake area (well, not in years... as kids we camped a lot in Speculator and Moffitt Beach). I will have to plan a camping trip there this summer. Not sure if we'll make it up any mountains though (Lucy might kill me in my sleep if I try getting her up another ADK mountain, ROFL!) but we'll certainly scout around for lower-lying boxes-- yeah! Oh man, now I can't wait for summer!</div>

<div>Two exceptions!  You planted your CMNT box is within three feet of my micro-dragon in Skaneateles. :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's interesting to hear what people like about planting letterboxes and finding letterboxes... so many various reasons... like you finding new places to plant is a biggie for you.   For me, I like to plant (and find) boxes that require a good hike. LOL maybe it's because I bring the dogs and they LOVE a good walkie! :o) I've found some drivebys since I started LB'ing but only when the dogs aren't with me (which, let's face it, is rare--we're attached at the hip, hee hee).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hmmm.... That would be a fun poll wouldn't it? Finding out what type of planting and finding people prefer? Do people prefer new places? Familiar places? Close-to-home places? Long hikes? Drivebys? Or does it even matter as long as they find a stamp? Hmmm.  :o\  Well, that's food for thought as lunch hour approaches...</div>

<div>Yeah, I do need to rehide that first box. I also need to find newer (better!) hiding spots along the trails for my L &amp; C Wildlife Adventures and Historic Auburn series, too. I've been mulling it over quite a bit lately, but there is such a VERY fine, VERY fine line between Letterboxing and Littering. Several of the boxes I planted last year ended up becoming vandalized/trashed because of MY bad hiding spots... they became LITTER. That just burns my butt because I just despise litterbugs with every cell in my body... and here I inadvertantly became one by bad box planting! :o( And that is just unacceptable. I guess as good stewards of the environment AND responsible letterboxers, we need to plant our boxes well enough that they will never, ever see the light of day unless delibrately found by another boxer, LOL. So my rehide spots now that winter has thawed will (hopefully) be better than before! :oP</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can certainly plant your Howland box, but I don't plan on heading out till late May/June. There is some idea in my head that the Island shuts down to visitors in the spring for either fowl hunting season or nesting/breeding season?? I need to go online and find out if this is true, or if I'm thinking of Montezuma Wildlife Refuge, or if I'm just pulling this info out of the wild blue yonder. :o) But if your box is willing to wait, I'd be glad to plant it! </div>

<div>Oh I know...I had already carved that stamp and hadn't looked up to see if a new one had been planted there...I was so embarrassed when I saw your listing! The funny thing is...I had thought about expanding my one box to three..since I felt there were some cool hiding places there...and you had chosen almost every one!  If you are rehiding Box #1, I suggest you try the ruins nearby those falls..as your current hiding place is RIGHT where fishermen sit...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to Howland Island today to plant my ONE box. Would you believe I hiked the 2 miles in and then realized I'd brought the wrong box??? I thought about going back to the car and getting it but then I realized that the hike total would be 8 miles for that location and I still had another box to plant! Sheesh....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I was wondering..if I mailed it to you would you hide it when you do yours? I have the hiding place all picked out and even marked with some empty shot cartridges I found. No biggie if you can't, but I am not sure when I will be out that way again...tomorrow I am heading to Buffalo to visit friends and will be planting a couple of boxes along the way. woo hooo......I love spring planting!</div>

<div>Two exceptions!  You planted your CMNT box is within three feet of my micro-dragon in Skaneateles. :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's interesting to hear what people like about planting letterboxes and finding letterboxes... so many various reasons... like you finding new places to plant is a biggie for you.   For me, I like to plant (and find) boxes that require a good hike. LOL maybe it's because I bring the dogs and they LOVE a good walkie! :o) I've found some drivebys since I started LB'ing but only when the dogs aren't with me (which, let's face it, is rare--we're attached at the hip, hee hee).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hmmm.... That would be a fun poll wouldn't it? Finding out what type of planting and finding people prefer? Do people prefer new places? Familiar places? Close-to-home places? Long hikes? Drivebys? Or does it even matter as long as they find a stamp? Hmmm.  :o\  Well, that's food for thought as lunch hour approaches...</div>

<div>OK...maybe I'll just plant ONE at Howland Island. I just have the one idea for there anyway. In general, I try to spread my stamps out to areas that have not been covered with boxes. In general, I don't mind a bit if someone puts a box some place that I 've hidden a box....as long as it's not on top of mine! One exception....Paul in SF and my Moss Island box. After he found my box there he was so excited about the location that he put his box literally 3 feet above mine! LOL But I don't care..the more the merrier..and it's almost like a bonus for looking for my box. My stamp in that one is soooo plain..it was one of the first I carved and I will probably need to replace it as it's made with the crumbly stuff..and his stamp is so beautiful. So maybe I am the bonus box for HIS letterbox!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yes, the blast furnaces at Tawahus are cool....let me know when you're heading up and maybe we can meet up! I'm going to be spending quite a lot of time in the Adirondacks this summer...</div>

<div>Hi Lockwench-- That's fine with me if you want to plant some stamps at Howland Island too... the more the merrier, and the more stamps there the more people might come out to Cayuga County and enjoy the Island! :o) It's a pretty huge area and there are 5-7 miles of trails. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ah, the Adirondacks... There is a stamp at Tawahus... not sure where in town it is though. Apparently there are several blast furnaces.  I have never been to the Indian Lake area (well, not in years... as kids we camped a lot in Speculator and Moffitt Beach). I will have to plan a camping trip there this summer. Not sure if we'll make it up any mountains though (Lucy might kill me in my sleep if I try getting her up another ADK mountain, ROFL!) but we'll certainly scout around for lower-lying boxes-- yeah! Oh man, now I can't wait for summer!</div>

were going missing..because of my planting choices. I am trying to <br/>
get better about it but I still screw up every once in awhile. It <br/>
took me a long time to get over planting in trees...because I would <br/>
just be so tempted by some of these great squirrel holes. Duh! The <br/>
squirrels didn't want my darn boxes blocking their spots and would <br/>
push them out. So I try to avoid obvious dens now.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will actually be hiding Howland Island myself because I <br/>
have to go to Rochester in a few weeks. But thank you anyway. I don't <br/>
know about the nesting deal but I do avoid the Island during hunting <br/>
season. There must be something on the internet about it. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I screwed up and carved the wrong design for my Howland <br/>
Island box too..but decided to stick with it because it still fit. <br/>
But my original idea was to do a carving of a pheasant, because that <br/>
Island used to be a big pheasant breeding farm. Ah well.<br/>
<br/>
I do try to "fit" my boxes to a place..but I have some that are just <br/>
nonsense boxes. It's good to have these in the trunk of the car ready <br/>
to go when you find a good place. Or when you're stranded in an out <br/>
of town bus station waiting for your ride.... *grin*<br/>
