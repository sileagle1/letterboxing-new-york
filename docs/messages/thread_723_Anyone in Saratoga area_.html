  It's been too quiet lately! Gas prices have been keeping me home, <br/>
don't know about the rest of you.  Anyway, there's an event posted on <br/>
AQ in Saratoga on the 29th at Congress Park.  Only a few have signed <br/>
up.  EnergyStar is hosting, and is requesting RSVP by the 27th.  I'd <br/>
like to do some boxing this summer before its over! Hope to see some of <br/>
you there!<br/>

cool to go to this event.<br/>
