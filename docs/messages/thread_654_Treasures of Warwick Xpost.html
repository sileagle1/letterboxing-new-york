                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-902915623">Last summer I had a friend hold this LB at the shop where she worked at the fair.  We had her <br/>
bosses permission and blessing  so I didn't feel real guilty about not asking the owners.  I <br/>
believe another boxer asked and was denied permission to plant there, but they certainly <br/>
instituted their own Letterboxing style treasure hunt.  My dilemma is this.  My friend will be <br/>
moving to PA next week and will not be able to hold the LB for me.  I would like to keep this <br/>
box in play but need some ideas on how this might happen, Any crafty and sly boxers who <br/>
might have advice or insight please e mail me at <a href="mailto:pblber65@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pblber65@...</a> or contact me through <br/>
AQ.  I know PadFoot Trehuggers have one out there too, Thanks for more reasons to enjoy <br/>
the fair, but I would really like to keep this one inside.  will xpost wherever I can.  Any input <br/>
yeah or nay would be appreciated.<br/>

it.  Part of the fun was your friend was so excited to see boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could make it a Word of Mouth Box.  Post some cryptic<br/>
clues that didn't say what ye olde place it was exactly, and have the<br/>
finder email you for more precise clues.  Or just say, "email owner<br/>
for clues", and post it in that town.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure this box will apply in theme without your friend, maybe you<br/>
will need a new buxom wench to hold it for you?<br/>
