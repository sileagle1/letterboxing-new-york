Trailhoundz has gotten me and my other best friend - Artichoke - hooked<br/>
on letterboxing.  The weather has been beautiful the past two weekends<br/>
for hunting.  I have found 25 stamps so far, and most of them in my own<br/>
backyard (so to speak) and I NEVER knew.  With winter on its way I will<br/>
be busy carving to plant letterboxes in the Spring.  Woo hoo!! <br/>
<br/>
I know Trailhoundz through greyhounds.  I have five of my own - Alyssa,<br/>
Maggie, Sally, Rimmy and John...and we have two cats...Willie and Echo. <br/>
No kids..just animals :-) <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say how much I enjoy letterboxing and thank you to all<br/>
the artists out there with your beautiful stamps.  <br/>

P.S. Happy Thanksgiving too!</div>

Thanks for the nice welcome.  It was great meeting you and Dandelion <br/>
and your stamps are beautiful.  Thanksgiving Day, I ventured out <br/>
with my husband in pursuit of your Fort Ontario and St. Paul's <br/>
Cemetary stamps.  We needed to work off our tofurkey <br/>
overindulgence!  We had a great time and felt very tough.  We <br/>
finished just as the weather was starting to kick up.  Trailhoundz <br/>
and Budgie were properly impressed when I showed them your beautiful <br/>
stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someday Budgie, Trailhoundz and I will welcome you guys <br/>
to 'our obsession', greyhounds!  It adds a fun dimension to the <br/>
activity to hike with your dogs.  I am sure anytime we arrange to <br/>
*conveniently be in neighborhood* again, Budgie will be sure to <br/>
bring John so he and Dandelion can be reunited.<br/>
