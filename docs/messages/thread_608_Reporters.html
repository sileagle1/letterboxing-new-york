                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-218591321">Ok...here it goes. I met with both the Post Standard reporter and the<br/>
reporter from the Syracuse New Times.  I insisted that both of them<br/>
accompany me on a letterboxing outing and both did so willingly. They<br/>
stamped in and everything, using a store bought stamp. I only brought<br/>
them to my own boxes and they both seemed to really enjoy it. The New<br/>
Times reporter and I did one of my 3 box series, where we discovered<br/>
the second box peeking out of it's hiding spot and the third box<br/>
scattered all over the ground..both the book and the stamp missing. It<br/>
sounds weird, but I was actually glad it happened as it was a vivid<br/>
example of what we planters face all the time. A quick perusal of the<br/>
logbook confirmed that the last finder was a new family who had just<br/>
discovered letterboxing in a Family Fun article and had rushed out to<br/>
make their first finds. I wrote them a gentle letter telling them<br/>
about the trashed box and reminded them about rehiding boxes better<br/>
than they find them and suggested they take the time to do some more<br/>
research on the various sites.<br/>
<br/>
With both reporters I tried to stress the only real rules I know for<br/>
letterboxing, besides general boxing etiquette.<br/>
'<br/>
1) Be stealthy.<br/>
2) Rehide boxes better than you found them.<br/>
3) Leave no trace.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with both reporters about the publicity issue and our general<br/>
policy of sharing public spaces with geocachers. Both reporters seemed<br/>
to be sensitive to the publicity controversy and both agreed it was a<br/>
wonderful hobby for people of all ages and abilities..with something<br/>
for everyone. Both said they wanted to continue and become active<br/>
letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
Both reporters said they contacted multiple people, and said they were<br/>
directed by their editors to keep contacting boxers until they found<br/>
someone willing to talk with them...newbies and oldtimers alike.<br/>
Neither wanted to do an article without letterboxer input, which I<br/>
really appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
I spent an average of 4 hours with each reporter. I hope local boxers<br/>
will feel I made some effort to educate the public and the media about<br/>
our hobby in a responsible and sensitive way.  If they don't like the<br/>
outcome, then I hope they will make an effort to contribute in the future.<br/>

I spoke to the reporters so I could have some measure of control regarding what got discussed.<br/><br/>If you are a new boxer/family that is really making a conscious effort to rehide boxers better than you find them, then you will be a very popular addition to this hobby. I know some boxers who take the stamp image without stamping in, as they don't count their finds anyway...so you can never really tell for sure who was the last visitor. But you can get a pretty good idea.  Boxes get uncovered for all kinds of reasons, but every planter will appreciate you
 taking the time to cover them well. It's not necessary to let the planter know you re-covered something, as it is <span style="font-weight:bold;">expected</span> you will do a decent job. But any kind of damage or missing parts should definately be reported to the planter. Fix something if you can, but let the planter know so they can check on it when they are in the area.<br/><br/>Letterboxing is spreading exponentially, and has been for several years. Think of it as a popular chain letter. Once it is out there it gets spread on and on and on. Over 100 articles have been written in just the last couple of years, as it is hard to ignore a hobby which has such positive aspects and can be shared by so many different kinds of people. These two reporters each had heard of letterboxing in different ways. One was told by her editor, and the other had heard about it in a meeting they shared with a local boxer. Both said they found local boxers by searching letterboxing.org and
 atlasquest.com and writing to a selection of  them.<br/><br/>As for the newbie designation? I am still called a newbie even though I have over 300 finds and 200 plants. Doesn't bother me in the least. I like to consider myself "newbie-friendly" anyhow.  Remember, EVERY boxer you meet was a newbie once. Some are just friendlier than others.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><i>vicki crozzoli &lt;kivic1215@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-83433286replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-83433286ygrp-text"> <div></div><div>Hey LW,</div> <div>So will your story come out soon in both of those papers?  Will they be eventually posted

<div>I would like to hear the response of the new boxers who probably left the box out in the open. If there is one. This is the second time someone said they wrote to somone. I asked about a response the first time and I don't believe the person who did the writing every responded. Maybe the new person never answered. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Frankly I am sick and tired of people being gentle and polite with new boxers who leave the boxes out in the open, or apparantely leave them in the open enough for somone else to come along and trash them. There is ::::::::::*NO* EXCUSE:::::::::::::: for any boxer, new or otherwise to not rehide properly. Why would any reasonably intelligent person think it was *ok* to leave the damn box out in the open???? If a newbie reads two freaking words about boxing, it's made pretty clear that the boxes HAVE TO BE HIDDEN SO NO ONE CAN SEE THEM. Hellooooooooooooo? That's the whole freaking point. How stupid does somone have to be to not get this??? Or how careless to not care? How stupid and/or careless does someone have to be to leave a :::::::::HANDCARVED STAMP::::::::::, that someone obviously spend time and talent on to CARVE :::::::out in the open:::::::::::: so that someone can see it, or rehide it poorly. This is not aimed at any post in particular and not aimed at anyone in particular, but I am fed up with the whole thing. </div>

But any kind of damage or missing parts should definately be reported to the planter. Fix something if you can, but let the planter know so they can check on it when they are in the area.<br/><br/>Letterboxing is spreading exponentially, and has been for several years. Think of it as a popular chain letter. Once it is out there it gets spread on and on and on. Over 100 articles have been written in just the last couple of years, as it is hard to ignore a hobby which has such positive aspects and can be shared by so many different kinds of people. These two reporters each had heard of letterboxing in different ways. One was told by her editor, and the other had heard about it in a meeting they shared with a local boxer. Both said they found local boxers by searching letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com and writing to a selection of  them.<br/><br/>As for the newbie designation? I am still called a newbie even though I have over 300 finds and 200 plants. Doesn't bother me in the least. I like to consider myself "newbie-friendly" anyhow.  Remember, EVERY boxer you meet was a newbie once. Some are just friendlier than others.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><i>vicki crozzoli &lt;kivic1215@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

<div>Hey LW,</div>
<div>So will your story come out soon in both of those papers?  Will they be eventually posted here for us that dont live there?  It sounds like you did a great job with them both.  Even just reading some of your posts, you can tell you are a person that cares deeply about keeping the integrity of the sport.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Being a new family to this, I am making a real conscience effort to make sure we hide better than we find.  One box was just sitting at the base of a tree and we covered it up.  I mentioned it to the planter.  Is that something a finder should do regularly, inform the planter if the box is poorly hidden, maybe take note of the previous finder?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Is there a recent interest in letterboxing?  I know we saw the article in Family Fun magazine, which is what started us on it.  How are these reporters finding people?  Not one single person I have talked to has heard about it, but there are many boxes hidden in the Rochester area.  Although, as we were leaving Applebees one night, I heard the word letterboxing come up somewhere near me, but I didnt see who spoke it, I was about to intrude and introduce myself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just want to say again, we have really enjoyed ourselves doing this, and I have loved reading all these posts.  I cant get enough of them, my eyes get buggy after a while.   Thanks to everyone that makes it such a great hobby and to all that answer all of our "newbie" questions with so much patience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BTW....how many boxes do you have to find before you are stripped of your "newbie" status??</div>

&gt; I have no idea when the stories will hit the papers, although I <br/>

November. I will definately try to post them here so people can <br/>
judge and take potshots at me. :)  But seriously, with so many of my <br/>
boxes planted in the area, I have the most to lose if the publicity <br/>
hurts the hobby. I spoke to the reporters so I could have some <br/>
measure of control regarding what got discussed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are a new boxer/family that is really making a conscious <br/>
effort to rehide boxers better than you find them, then you will be <br/>
a very popular addition to this hobby. I know some boxers who take <br/>
the stamp image without stamping in, as they don't count their finds <br/>
anyway...so you can never really tell for sure who was the last <br/>
visitor. But you can get a pretty good idea.  Boxes get uncovered <br/>

Both of them guessed probably the first week of November. I will definately try to post them here so people can judge and take potshots at me. :)  But seriously, with so many of my boxes planted in the area, I have the most to lose if the publicity hurts the hobby. I spoke to the reporters so I could have some measure of control regarding what got discussed.<br/><br/>If you are a new boxer/family that is really making a conscious effort to rehide boxers better than you find them, then you will be a very popular addition to this hobby. I know some boxers who take the stamp image without stamping in, as they don't count their finds anyway...so you can never really tell for sure who was the last visitor. But you can get a pretty good
 idea.  Boxes get uncovered for all kinds of reasons, but every planter will appreciate you taking the time to cover them well. It's not necessary to let the planter know you re-covered something, as it is <span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">expected</span> you will do a decent job. But any kind of damage or missing parts should definately be reported to the planter. Fix something if you can, but let the planter know so they can check on it when they are in the area.<br/><br/>Letterboxing is spreading exponentially, and has been for several years. Think of it as a popular chain letter. Once it is out there it gets spread on and on and on. Over 100 articles have been written in just the last couple of years, as it is hard to ignore a hobby which has such positive aspects and can be shared by so many different kinds of people. These two reporters each had heard of letterboxing in different ways. One was told by her editor, and the other had heard about it in a meeting they
 shared with a local boxer. Both said they found local boxers by searching letterboxing. org and atlasquest.com and writing to a selection of  them.<br/><br/>As for the newbie designation? I am still called a newbie even though I have over 300 finds and 200 plants. Doesn't bother me in the least. I like to consider myself "newbie-friendly" anyhow.  Remember, EVERY boxer you meet was a newbie once. Some are just friendlier than others.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><i>vicki crozzoli &lt;kivic1215@yahoo. com&gt;</i></b> wrote:   <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-527574677replbq" style="BORDER-LEFT:rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-527574677ygrp-text"> <div></div> <div>Hey LW,</div> <div>So will your story come out soon in both of those papers?  Will they be eventually posted here for us that dont live there?  It sounds like you did a great job with them both.  Even just reading some of your posts, you can tell you are a person that cares deeply about

I met with both the Post Standard reporter and the<br/>reporter from the Syracuse New Times. I insisted that both of them<br/>accompany me on a letterboxing outing and both did so willingly. They<br/>stamped in and everything, using a store bought
 stamp. I only brought<br/>them to my own boxes and they both seemed to really enjoy it. The New<br/>Times reporter and I did one of my 3 box series, where we discovered<br/>the second box peeking out of it's hiding spot and the third box<br/>scattered all over the ground..both the book and the stamp missing. It<br/>sounds weird, but I was actually glad it happened as it was a vivid<br/>example of what we planters face all the time. A quick perusal of the<br/>logbook confirmed that the last finder was a new family who had just<br/>discovered letterboxing in a Family Fun article and had rushed out to<br/>make their first finds. I wrote them a gentle letter telling them<br/>about the trashed box and reminded them about rehiding boxes better<br/>than they find them and suggested they take the time to do some more<br/>research on the various sites.<br/><br/>With both reporters I tried to stress the only real rules I know for<br/>letterboxing, besides general boxing etiquette.<br/>'<br/>1) Be
 stealthy.<br/>2) Rehide boxes better than you found them.<br/>3) Leave no trace.<br/><br/>I spoke with both reporters about the publicity issue and our general<br/>policy of sharing public spaces with geocachers. Both reporters seemed<br/>to be sensitive to the publicity controversy and both agreed it was a<br/>wonderful hobby for people of all ages and abilities..with something<br/>for everyone. Both said they wanted to continue and become active<br/>letterboxers. <br/><br/>Both reporters said they contacted multiple people, and said they were<br/>directed by their editors to keep contacting boxers until they found<br/>someone willing to talk with them...newbies and oldtimers alike.<br/>Neither wanted to do an article without letterboxer input, which I<br/>really appreciated. <br/><br/>I spent an average of 4 hours with each reporter. I hope local boxers<br/>will feel I made some effort to educate the public and the media about<br/>our hobby in a responsible and sensitive way. If they don't
 like the<br/>outcome, then I hope they will make an effort to contribute in the future.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/> <div></div> <hr size="1"/>  Get your email and more, right on the <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=42973/*http://www.yahoo.com/preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Yahoo.com</a> <div></div></div></blockquote><br/> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Yahoo!

catch the smile by the way...lol)  THE CHANCE TO EDUCATE NEW BOXERS,<br/>
GEOCACHERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I was a geocacher before I was a<br/>
boxer and I see a distinct difference in how are hobbies are played. I<br/>
am sick of having to play by geocaching rules when I box (1/4 mile<br/>
apart, 10 foot off of a trail,no planting boxes farther than 250 miles<br/>
from home etc). I am trying to separate letterboxing from geocaching<br/>
and show the reasons why people choose one over the other. <br/>
<br/>
Regarding beginning boxers, I think you are being unreasonably harsh.<br/>
After I had found about 20 boxes, I was lucky enough to go boxing with<br/>
a seasoned boxer who let me hide the rehide the box under her<br/>
supervision. She showed me how even my very thick covering of leaves<br/>
and other forest debris could be blown off by a heavy wind or dragged<br/>
off by an animal. She showed me why my carefully arranged pile of<br/>
sticks (while covering the box completely) screamed: HERE IS A<br/>
LETTERBOX!!!!!!! She showed me why a scattering of leaves, PLUS a rock<br/>
for weight and then MORE forest litter gave a box a fighting chance.<br/>
How hiding on the far side of the log still hid the box from passersby<br/>
if the covering somehow was compromised. How a box wedged under a rock<br/>
edge can work as well as a loose rock to prevent an animal from<br/>
dragging it off. How retracing your steps into an area lessens the<br/>
chance of a "spur trail" being formed directly to the box. I took her<br/>
lessons even farther and now spray paint all my Lock n Locks with<br/>
plastic Fusion spraypaint and cover the flat areas with camo tape. I<br/>
don't plant next to playgrounds (except for one notable exception) or<br/>
anywhere else kids are likely to explore and discover a box.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am gentle the first time is because this seasoned boxer<br/>
was gentle with me.    She saw that I had good intent, but little<br/>
experience.    She knew I wasn't trying to rush and she knew I wasn't<br/>
trying to "disrespect the boxer."  She didn't just YELL at me to<br/>
rehide better, she TAUGHT me how to rehide better. She didn't bash me<br/>
on the boards and treat me like a clueless idiot, but as someone who<br/>
could learn very quickly if just given 10-15 minutes of her valuable<br/>
time. It is for this reason that I will continue to camo my boxes,<br/>
teach when I can, and have my FIRST letter to a boxer be a gentle one<br/>
and not make assumptions. <br/>

I am sorry, but it doesn't take just  a medical emergency, a full bladder/sick stomach, dangerous animal for me to abandon a box. If my personal safety radar is going off, I will choose ME over a plastic box ANYDAY! <br/><br/>That being said, I did report it to the planter. And if and when I get a response from the person I wrote to, I will post it here verbatim, but without the name. But I can virtually guarantee what they will say if they answer. They will be embarrassed, they will apologize emphatically, and then they will sheepishly admit they are newboxers who are on a learning curve and will promise to do better. How do I know this?

Where you steer the participant with clues/directions/compass reading and paces rather than having them start nearly anywhere. You also usually lead them right to the box rather than to a general area where you are left to your own devices to find the box...some of them not pretty!  Hence trampled flora, disturbed fauna and trashed historic rock walls.<br/><br/>Sure you can break the rules and plant where you are not supposed to, or without a permit, etc. and take your chances, but I would rather not have my work thrown away or worse yet, receive a fine. I already spend enough money on this hobby...lol<br/><br/>And I just want to say that just because I am voicing my opinion, I do not expect everyone to play the way I do.

 make their own informed decisions. I don't mind in the least if some play differently than me.

She showed me how even my very thick covering of leaves<br/>and other forest debris could be blown off by a heavy wind or dragged<br/>off by an animal. She showed me why my carefully arranged pile of<br/>sticks (while covering the box completely) screamed: HERE IS A<br/>LETTERBOX!!! !!!! She showed me why a scattering of leaves, PLUS a rock<br/>for weight and then MORE forest litter gave a box a fighting chance.<br/>How hiding on the far side of the log still hid
 the box from passersby<br/>if the covering somehow was compromised. How a box wedged under a rock<br/>edge can work as well as a loose rock to prevent an animal from<br/>dragging it off. How retracing your steps into an area lessens the<br/>chance of a "spur trail" being formed directly to the box. I took her<br/>lessons even farther and now spray paint all my Lock n Locks with<br/>plastic Fusion spraypaint and cover the flat areas with camo tape. I<br/>don't plant next to playgrounds (except for one notable exception) or<br/>anywhere else kids are likely to explore and discover a box.<br/><br/>The reason I am gentle the first time is because this seasoned boxer<br/>was gentle with me. She saw that I had good intent, but little<br/>experience. She knew I wasn't trying to rush and she knew I wasn't<br/>trying to "disrespect the boxer." She didn't just YELL at me to<br/>rehide better, she TAUGHT me how to rehide better. She didn't bash me<br/>on the boards and treat me like a clueless
 idiot, but as someone who<br/>could learn very quickly if just given 10-15 minutes of her valuable<br/>time. It is for this reason that I will continue to camo my boxes,<br/>teach when I can, and have my FIRST letter to a boxer be a gentle one<br/>and not make assumptions. <br/><br/>LW<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:LbNY%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LbNY@yahoogroups. com</a>, "June" &lt;nfmoon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you.

boxers I sent an email to, letting them know that most of the boxes of
my CCC series were left out totally or partially exposed (I had come
along only a couple hours after they had been through). *Hrmf*  :oP<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Lockwench that we've ALL been new boxers once. We all make
mistakes. I'm sure when I started out there were boxes that I thought I
covered well but didn't check from all angles to make sure it was
covered ALL THE WAY, from ALL sides. My first plants were not in the
best of places and some were really obvious, sticking out of the
environment like a sore thumb. :o)  I don't think anyone can
seriously complain about the learning curve because we've all been
there. HOWEVER, to search for boxes and leave them totally exposed
after you've finished with them... to just chunk them back into the
hiding spot or drop them in back of a rock and not bother to re-hide at
ALL... that is something totally different.  Like Miss Moon says,
that's total apathy and lack of respect.  You don't need to be an
apprentice to someone who has been boxing for 70 years to know that is
wrong, disrespectful, and against the whole premise of boxing. 
You don't need to be a Harvard graduate to know that simply leaving a
box out in the open is against the integrity of the sport. :oP<br/>
<br/>
I pulled my CCC boxes because I was ticked, and it is such a
high-traffic trail that people leaving these boxes even partially
exposed would be a high-vandalization risk. I've been told subtly over
email "that if I can't handle boxes being lost, then maybe I shouldn't
plant." To me, this is very poor attitude to go in with. It's a
laisse-faire type of thinking that breeds apathy and dis-attachment for
the planter. It gives them an excuse to plant badly and expect their
box to be stolen, be  an environmental risk, and become eventual
litter. As a planter myself, I know boxes will come up missing
occassionally due to animals, weather, etc.. HOWEVER, I also, as 
a planter who has invested time, money and energy in costructing,
carving, and planting a box-- have  the right to expect my box be
treated with integrity and respect.  :o/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to that extent, I've updated my website (where my LB clues are
posted) with a "Letterboxing Rules to Live By" list. Here's the link:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.jenzstudio.com/html/planted.html<br/>
<br/>
There is only one thing I forgot to put in there, and that is about
letting children re-hide letterboxes. Parents should ALWAYS ALWAYS
check after their kids re-hide.  They may think their little
kiddies are Letterboxing Prodigies, but children are especially prone
to apathy in their excitement to move on to the next box, and therefore
need to be double checked. ALWAYS.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully any boxers coming to my website to download my clues will see
(and read) the obnoxious glaring yellow box, LOL, and give the integral
rules and respect of letterboxing another thought. :o)<br/>

<div>I would like to hear the response of the new boxers who probably
left the box out in the open. If there is one. This is the second time
someone said they wrote to somone. I asked about a response the first
time and I don't believe the person who did the writing every
responded. Maybe the new person never answered. </div>

<div>Frankly I am sick and tired of people being gentle and polite with
new boxers who leave the boxes out in the open, or apparantely leave
them in the open enough for somone else to come along and trash them.
There is ::::::::::*NO* EXCUSE:::::: :::::::: for any boxer, new or
otherwise to not rehide properly. Why would any reasonably
intelligent person think it was *ok* to leave the damn box out in the
open???? If a newbie reads two freaking words about boxing, it's
made pretty clear that the boxes HAVE TO BE HIDDEN SO NO ONE CAN SEE
THEM. Hellooooooooooooo? That's the whole freaking point. How stupid
does somone have to be to not get this??? Or how careless to not care?
How stupid and/or careless does someone have to be to leave a
:::::::::HANDCARVED STAMP::::::: :::, that someone obviously spend time and talent on to CARVE :::::::out in the open:::::::: ::::
so that someone can see it, or rehide it poorly. This is not aimed
at any post in particular and not aimed at anyone in particular, but I
am fed up with the whole thing. </div>

<div><br/></div><font size="2">I have no idea when the stories will hit
the papers, although I let each of the reporters know that the other
was working on the same project. Both of them guessed probably the
first week of November. I will definately try to post them here so
people can judge and take potshots at me. :)  But seriously, with
so many of my boxes planted in the area, I have the most to lose if the
publicity hurts the hobby. I spoke to the reporters so I could have
some measure of control regarding what got discussed.<br/><br/>If you are
a new boxer/family that is really making a conscious effort to rehide
boxers better than you find them, then you will be a very popular
addition to this hobby. I know some boxers who take the stamp image
without stamping in, as they don't count their finds anyway...so you
can never really tell for sure who was the last visitor. But you can
get a pretty good idea.  Boxes get uncovered for all kinds of
reasons, but every planter will appreciate you taking the time to cover
them well. It's not necessary to let the planter know you re-covered
something, as it is <span style="font-weight:bold;">expected</span>
you will do a decent job. But any kind of damage or missing parts
should definately be reported to the planter. Fix something if you can,
but let the planter know so they can check on it when they are in the
area.<br/><br/>Letterboxing is spreading exponentially, and has been for
several years. Think of it as a popular chain letter. Once it is out
there it gets spread on and on and on. Over 100 articles have been
written in just the last couple of years, as it is hard to ignore a
hobby which has such positive aspects and can be shared by so many
different kinds of people. These two reporters each had heard of
letterboxing in different ways. One was told by her editor, and the
other had heard about it in a meeting they shared with a local boxer.
Both said they found local boxers by searching letterboxing. org and atlasquest.com and writing to a selection of  them.<br/><br/>As
for the newbie designation? I am still called a newbie even though I
have over 300 finds and 200 plants. Doesn't bother me in the least. I
like to consider myself "newbie-friendly" anyhow.  Remember, EVERY
boxer you meet was a newbie once. Some are just friendlier than others.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><i>vicki crozzoli &lt;kivic1215@yahoo. com&gt;</i></b> wrote:

<div><font size="2">Hey LW,</font></div>
<div><font size="2">So will your story come out soon in both of those
papers?  Will they be eventually posted here for us that dont live
there?  It sounds like you did a great job with them both. 
Even just reading some of your posts, you can tell you are a person
that cares deeply about keeping the integrity of the sport.  </font></div>

<div><font size="2">Being a new family to this, I am making a real
conscience effort to make sure we hide better than we find.  One
box was just sitting at the base of a tree and we covered it up. 
I mentioned it to the planter.  Is that something a finder should
do regularly, inform the planter if the box is poorly hidden, maybe
take note of the previous finder?</font></div>
<div><font size="2"> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">Is there a recent interest in
letterboxing?  I know we saw the article in Family Fun magazine,
which is what started us on it.  How are these reporters finding
people?  Not one single person I have talked to has heard about
it, but there are many boxes hidden in the Rochester area. 
Although, as we were leaving Applebees one night, I heard the word
letterboxing come up somewhere near me, but I didnt see who spoke it, I
was about to intrude and introduce myself.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">I just want to say again, we have really enjoyed
ourselves doing this, and I have loved reading all these posts.  I
cant get enough of them, my eyes get buggy after a while.  
Thanks to everyone that makes it such a great hobby and to all that
answer all of our "newbie" questions with so much patience.</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Ok...here it goes. I met with both the Post Standard reporter and the<br/>reporter from the Syracuse New Times. I insisted that both of them<br/>accompany me on a letterboxing outing and both did so willingly. They<br/>stamped in and everything, using a store bought stamp. I only brought<br/>them to my own boxes and they both seemed to really enjoy it. The New<br/>Times reporter and I did one of my 3 box series, where we discovered<br/>the second box peeking out of it's hiding spot and the third box<br/>scattered all over the ground..both the book and the stamp missing. It<br/>sounds weird, but I was actually glad it happened as it was a vivid<br/>example of what we planters face all the time. A quick perusal of the<br/>logbook confirmed that the last finder was a new family who had just<br/>discovered letterboxing in a Family Fun article and had rushed out to<br/>make their first finds. I wrote them a gentle letter telling them<br/>about the trashed box and reminded them about rehiding boxes better<br/>than they find them and suggested they take the time to do some more<br/>research on the various sites.<br/><br/>With both reporters I tried to stress the only real rules I know for<br/>letterboxing, besides general boxing etiquette.<br/>'<br/>1) Be stealthy.<br/>2) Rehide boxes better than you found them.<br/>3) Leave no trace.<br/><br/>I spoke with both reporters about the publicity issue and our general<br/>policy of sharing public spaces with geocachers. Both reporters seemed<br/>to be sensitive to the publicity controversy and both agreed it was a<br/>wonderful hobby for people of all ages and abilities..with something<br/>for everyone. Both said they wanted to continue and become active<br/>letterboxers. <br/><br/>Both reporters said they contacted multiple people, and said they were<br/>directed by their editors to keep contacting boxers until they found<br/>someone willing to talk with them...newbies and oldtimers alike.<br/>Neither wanted to do an article without letterboxer input, which I<br/>really appreciated. <br/><br/>I spent an average of 4 hours with each reporter. I hope local boxers<br/>will feel I made some effort to educate the public and the media about<br/>our hobby in a responsible and sensitive way. If they don't like the<br/>outcome, then I hope they will make an effort to contribute in the future.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/></font></div></div></blockquote><font size="2"><br/>

( I did<br/>catch the smile by the way...lol) THE CHANCE TO EDUCATE NEW BOXERS,<br/>GEOCACHERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I was a geocacher before I was a<br/>boxer and I see a distinct difference in how are hobbies are  played. I<br/>am sick of having to play by geocaching rules when I box (1/4 mile<br/>apart, 10 foot off of a trail,no planting boxes farther than 250 miles<br/>from home etc). I am trying to separate letterboxing from geocaching<br/>and show the reasons why people choose one over the other. <br/><br/>Regarding beginning boxers, I think you are being unreasonably harsh.<br/>After I had found about 20 boxes, I was lucky enough to go boxing with<br/>a seasoned boxer who let me hide the rehide the box under her<br/>supervision. She showed me how even my very thick covering of leaves<br/>and other forest
 debris could be blown off by a heavy wind or dragged<br/>off by an animal. She showed me why my carefully arranged pile of<br/>sticks (while covering the box completely) screamed: HERE IS A<br/>LETTERBOX!!! !!!! She showed me why a scattering of leaves, PLUS a rock<br/>for weight and then MORE forest litter gave a box a fighting chance.<br/>How hiding on the far side of the log still hid  the box from passersby<br/>if the covering somehow was compromised. How a box wedged under a rock<br/>edge can work as well as a loose rock to prevent an animal from<br/>dragging it off. How retracing your steps into an area lessens the<br/>chance of a "spur trail" being formed directly to the box. I took her<br/>lessons even farther and now spray paint all my Lock n Locks with<br/>plastic Fusion spraypaint and cover the flat areas with camo tape. I<br/>don't plant next to playgrounds (except for one notable exception) or<br/>anywhere else kids are likely to explore and discover a box.<br/><br/>The
 reason I am gentle the first time is because this seasoned boxer<br/>was gentle with me. She saw that I had good intent, but little<br/>experience. She knew I wasn't trying to rush and she knew I wasn't<br/>trying to "disrespect the boxer." She didn't just YELL at me to<br/>rehide better, she TAUGHT me how to rehide better. She didn't bash me<br/>on the boards and treat me like a clueless  idiot, but as someone who<br/>could learn very quickly if just given 10-15 minutes of her valuable<br/>time. It is for this reason that I will continue to camo my boxes,<br/>teach when I can, and have my FIRST letter to a boxer be a gentle one<br/>and not make assumptions. <br/><br/>LW<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:LbNY%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LbNY@yahoogroups. com</a>, "June" &lt;nfmoon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you. I feel pretty much the same way. Other than an emergency,<br/>there<br/>&gt; is NO reason to not rehide properly. If a person is not willing to<br/>do what<br/>&gt; it takes to

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I will admit to you right here and now that I once left a <br/>
geocache sitting right out in the open when I was surprised by a <br/>
strange man on a trail. I am sorry, but it doesn't take just  a <br/>
medical emergency, a full bladder/sick stomach, dangerous animal for <br/>
me to abandon a box. If my personal safety radar is going off, I will <br/>
choose ME over a plastic box ANYDAY! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That being said, I did report it to the planter. And if and when I <br/>
get a response from the person I wrote to, I will post it here <br/>
verbatim, but without the name. But I can virtually guarantee what <br/>
they will say if they answer. They will be embarrassed, they will <br/>
apologize emphatically, and then they will sheepishly admit they are <br/>
newboxers who are on a learning curve and will promise to do better. <br/>
How do I know this? Because I have written probably two dozen of <br/>
these letters in the past and that is the majority of the responses I <br/>
get. In my own personal experience, my method rarely scares away a <br/>
newboxer but instead makes a boxer more committed to good practices. <br/>
I guess my mom was right when she said you catch more flies with <br/>
honey....<br/>

<div> I've been told subtly over email "that if I can't handle boxes being lost, then maybe I shouldn't plant." To me, this is very poor attitude to go in with. It's a laisse-faire type of thinking that breeds apathy and dis-attachment for the planter. It gives them an excuse to plant badly and expect their box to be stolen, be  an environmental risk, and become eventual litter. As a planter myself, I know boxes will come up missing occassionally due to animals, weather, etc.. HOWEVER, I also, as  a planter who has invested time, money and energy in costructing, carving, and planting a box-- have  the right to expect my box be treated with integrity and respect.  :o/<br/></div>

boxes weren't rehidden and there was no wind/wild animals/childen<br/>
playing around and it was multiple boxes exposed, of COURSE I would<br/>
suspect the last boxer did a piss-poor job or had to leave in a hurry.<br/>
But I wanted to state all those potential reasons so that new boxers<br/>
reading this site would not assume the worst when their boxes are<br/>
exposed. I just think it's important to state all the potential<br/>
problems when you are talking about exposed boxes....including<br/>
choosing spots that are very active. If I have to replace a box more<br/>
than  two or three times...I abandon the spot and plant somewhere else.<br/>
