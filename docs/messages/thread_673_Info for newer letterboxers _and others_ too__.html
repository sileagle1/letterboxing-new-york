LbNY (see box at left of screen). There are many links with a lot of <br/>
helpful information. <br/>
<br/>
Of the links, I especially find AtlasQuest.com to be THE most useful <br/>
site for letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't signed up already, I highly recommended that you <br/>
consider it because Atlasquest has lots of great features: a online <br/>
logbook that shows your plants &amp; finds, and an advanced search <br/>
function to identify letterboxes located along a trip route as well <br/>
as in a town or area. After searching you can select boxes with <br/>
checkboxes, and get all of them printed continously. That saves a lot <br/>
of paper! There are tutorials on letterboxing topics such as carving. <br/>
profiles of letterboxers, supplies that can be ordered, and of <br/>
course, mail messages. <br/>
<br/>
It keeps your counts for Plants, Finds, Exchanges, and more; notifies <br/>
you when someone has recorded a Find or an Attempt on a box you <br/>
planted; and uses a complete global place name listing so that boxes <br/>
in international and obscure places can be accomodated! And there's <br/>
still more stuff that I haven't included here!!!<br/>
<br/>
LbNY members, if you haven't used AtlasQuest, check it out!<br/>

By the way, she's right. You can't post unlisted finds on AQ without<br/>
paying a certain amount a year (think it's like $24 or something now)<br/>
to list anything you find). I don't think you can do it at all on<br/>
LBNA, though, so it's "six of one, half a dozen of the other".<br/>
<br/>
Both boards have their up and down sides, but the best bet as a boxer<br/>
is to use them both...that way you can find any boxes you want.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it really working right now? I kept having trouble with it and<br/>
&gt; finally gave up on it myself. If it's back now, I'll start posting<br/>
&gt; some more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, she's right. You can't post unlisted finds on AQ without<br/>
&gt; paying a certain amount a year (think it's like $24 or something now)<br/>
&gt; to list anything you find). I don't think you can do it at all on<br/>
&gt; LBNA, though, so it's "six of one, half a dozen of the other".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both boards have their up and down sides, but the best bet as a boxer<br/>
&gt; is to use them both...that way you can find any boxes you want.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, Miss Moon! Letterboxing.org is also a great site -- I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; merely figured that new Lbers would be more likely to come across it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than they would AQ. And letterboxing.org was having server problems a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while ago due to all the traffic.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No commercial intended -- after all, I didn't tell them to buy <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; premium membership, did I?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; How've you been Miss Moon?<br/>
