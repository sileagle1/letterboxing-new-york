shot in the arm for us.  Previous to that, we had gone out a couple times<br/>

the hubby out there.  I'm a home schooling SAHM, so we sometimes try to grab<br/>

boxing.  <br/>

I guess you'd have to call me a carve-o-phobic.  I've never been the<br/>

event (thank you, catbead!!!), I felt a certain moral responsibility to give<br/>
it my best shot.  I have 6 stamps ready and will do some planting as soon as<br/>
it is possible to do so without taking a snow blower along...<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1626359773">Welcome Kaycee - My name is Kathy the "Ma" of the Lboxing clan called:<br/>
Pookah Clan.  We are also a homeschooling family and we just have been<br/>
letterboxing since Spring 2004 as well.  My husband is more of a<br/>
letterboxing "freak" then the rest of us - he LOVES every aspect of it!<br/>
Maybe yours will "come around" in the future.    We live in Madison County -<br/>
and sometime if you are ever in this area come and check out the boxes we<br/>
have planted (they are removed right now due to snow but will be back in the<br/>
spring). ( I was born and raised in Geneva - my folks still live there and<br/>
we go to visit them often- where are you in Western NY?)<br/>
<br/>
WELCOME!<br/>
Kathy<br/>
