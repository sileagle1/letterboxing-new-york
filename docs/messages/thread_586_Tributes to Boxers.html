Goose Chaser and Boxer in TRAINing( Fungus Woman's dad, who was an<br/>
avid boxer). If you would like to send a condolence card to the<br/>
family, signed with your signature stamp, please contact me for the<br/>
addresses and I will forward them to you. Ryan of Atlasquest will also<br/>
forward any cards he receives at his own address and is working on a<br/>
tribute area on the Atlasquest site.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
