I've just retired the WOM/snail mail clue box Wildflowers of Ithaca #4: <br/>
Marsh Marigold and its bonus box Crocus. I've also retired the limited-time <br/>
availability box Dragon Day as well as the Challenge of the Sprite series <br/>
that was hidden in a grocery store that shall not be named (where two of <br/>
the three survived for almost two years!). The serial storybook Woods at <br/>
Midnight box was retired after the 2006 Finger Lakes gathering, and my <br/>
personal traveller On the Way Gnome has also gone to that great <br/>
letterboxing resting place in the sky. That should be it for retirements <br/>
for some time!<br/>
