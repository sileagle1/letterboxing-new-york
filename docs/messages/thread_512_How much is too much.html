<br/>
Is there such a thing as having too many boxes in one location?  I'm <br/>
working on my cemetary series (which has four boxes to date, and at <br/>
least four more in the process of being carved).  I went to find <br/>
some new boxes today, which were located in a cemetary I wasn't <br/>
familiar with and would make the neatest addition to my series.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my dilemna ... there is already a series of 3 boxes located <br/>
in the cemetary, as well as a fourth box planted by a different <br/>
letterboxer.  It's a really big place, and I could hide another box <br/>
for my series easily without interfereing with the existing boxes.  <br/>
But I don't want to step on toes by adding a fifth box.  As long as <br/>
I found a location AWAY from the other 4 boxes, and not somewhere <br/>
that's disrespectful to those buried in the cemetary (and their <br/>
families), would that be acceptable?<br/>
<br/>
There are other areas locally that are starting to "overlap" boxes <br/>
as well.  Seems like good old Broome County is finally catching up <br/>
to the rest of NY!!!  YAY!!!!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Songchick - I have been very happy to see all the boxes you've been <br/>
planting in New York State! I, for one, do not think we are in danger <br/>
of becoming another CT. The more, the merrier. If you are really <br/>
concerned about crowding another person's boxes, then I would email <br/>
them and tell them what you have in mind, and see if it bothers them. <br/>
If you receive no response after a week, I would go ahead and plant. <br/>
No one "OWNS" a location, so traditional etiquette is all that would <br/>
be required. <br/>
<br/>
My friend Paul planted a box only a couple of feet above one of mine! <br/>
It didn't bother me in the least. I figure it brings more people to <br/>
both of our boxes.<br/>
