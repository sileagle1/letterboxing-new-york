weekend in Syracuse at the OnCenter. It's a 2 day event and I thought I <br/>
would make it to one of the days. Is anyone interested in meeting up <br/>
there? <br/>
<br/>
There is a 3 box series of mine within walking distance of the <br/>
Convention Center as well...the Poetry Series in Armory Square. It's <br/>
really fun to read the wonderful poetry added by letterboxers...<br/>
<br/>
I had planned on going to the Massachusetts gathering but decided to <br/>
pass as it is going to be a HUGE gathering...120 people and counting. I <br/>
think I would be a little overwhelmed there trying to meet everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if anyone is interested in meeting up at this convention, just <br/>
drop me a line.....<br/>
