Star-Cat-Star and I headed to Angola Sunday the 23rd to check both <br/>
the boxes there.  We didn't find either, however the place was so <br/>
crowded I'm not convinced that someone didn't have them (that's <br/>
happened to me before on the thruway).  If/when any of you guys find <br/>
yourselves in the Angola are (Dagonell???), could you please, please <br/>
double check?<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, the 29th, SCS and I stopped at the Scottsville rest stop <br/>
(on our way to CNY Feis - Songchick I got your email too late....we <br/>
were on stage 4 all day)and went to check the back of the Historical <br/>
Marker...the Historical Marker...the Hist-dagnabbit!  It's completely <br/>
gone!  Not just the letterbox, but the Historcal Marker!  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
On our way home we stopped to check on the NYS Beverage - is that the <br/>
Ontario rest stop?  Hard to keep them straight.  Anyway, the beverage <br/>
was safe and sound, and had just been stamped into the day before.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to check all the canal ones within the next week or so <br/>
("Thankful Along the Canal") Daina - we'll be prowling around Medina <br/>
Thursday evening - maybe we can mmet up.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the beautiful weather.<br/>
