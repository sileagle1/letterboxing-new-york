Cross and Scottish Thistle letterboxes at St. Paul's in Oswego, <br/>
they've been retired. With the terrible wind that we've had the past <br/>
few days, I had a feeling that I needed to check on them. It was a <br/>
good thing I did because the tree that was housing the Cross had <br/>
toppled over earlier in the day. These 2 boxes have given us trouble <br/>
in the past (in the re-hiding department) and the logbook pages were <br/>
just about full anyway, so I figured replacing them elsewhere in the <br/>
cemetery would probably just be pressing my luck. LBNA and AQ have <br/>
been updated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the folks who found these boxes! <br/>
