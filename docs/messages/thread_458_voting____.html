LbOn are also picking a logo/patch too and so far no bloodshed.  But<br/>
all is not final yet!  There are only 29 LbOn members registered and<br/>
few of those seem to have "voted"; only 2 members submitted logo<br/>
ideas.  While I'd like to see one of mine chosen it may not happen. <br/>
Hoover, who boxes as well as caches (GASP!), has some nice designs. <br/>
I've been reading the LbPNw group (350 boxers!) for a while now (we're<br/>
heading west on Monday)and they are in the painful stages of voting on<br/>
a logo as well.  Birth is messy!<br/>
With permission to quote, here's a funny post from Glenn, one of the<br/>
LbPNW members:<br/>
"An idea........................<br/>
We might consider breaking the LbPNW members out geographically and<br/>
also by age, sex and marital status before any kind of vote is taken.<br/>
I personally don't want a "kid" or worse yet any female voting on<br/>
this. They could be allowed to voice their opinion, once, but nothing<br/>
more. Probably those south of the Columbia River and of a different<br/>
ethnic group than me should only get half a vote and only during the<br/>
last vote. I like the idea of a triple elimination, sudden death,<br/>
first seed advantage, round robin format. Then put all the choices in<br/>
a box below a football goal post and let a blindfolded midget acrobat<br/>
bunji cord jump and grab the winner in his teeth.<br/>
Just an idea."<br/>
