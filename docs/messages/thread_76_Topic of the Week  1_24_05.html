                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-881621822">My favorite was in creating the underwater letterbox that I mentioned here <br/>
before. It was called, "The Hunt for the Temple of Neptune in the former <br/>
city of Atlantis, Tlamco".<br/>
<br/>
There's been a legend here in San Francisco that goes back to the late 1800s <br/>
that says that SF was once the site of the city Tlamco, in Atlantis. (And <br/>
this was well before the LSD days!). Psychics say that they've identified <br/>
the sites of the former locations of several of the temples once located <br/>
here. They are arranged  much like the paths of the planets they are named <br/>
after, with the Temple of the Sun at the center, appropriately sitting smack <br/>
dab in Haight-Ashbury.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Neptune supposedly sat on Strawberry Hill which is a small <br/>
island on Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park. This is a interesting location, as <br/>
a manmade waterfall runs down Strawberry Hill, and there's a colorful <br/>
Chinese pavilion at its base. Three small wooden bridge pass back &amp; forth <br/>
over the waterfall on a path leading to the top of the hill. So the <br/>
letterbox was in a pool of water on a ledge in the waterfall, attached to <br/>
the bridge by monofilament line, and kept in place in the water with a lead <br/>
weight.<br/>
<br/>
To find the box, you had to read a map, unscramble an inscription anagram, <br/>
and head to Stow Lake. Then you had to find two small boxes hidden on <br/>
Strawberry Hill first. I gave 5 possible locations, so 3 were false leads. <br/>
When you found the 2 boxes, inside each was 1/2 of a cryptic diagram, and <br/>
some strange writing (Atlantean code). Also inside each were 2 strips of <br/>
flexible polymer clay, that looked like old metal. One had strange <br/>
characters, the other, English letters. By lining up beads on them, you <br/>
could decode the word, "bridge", and the diagram suddenly made sense, <br/>
because it showed a line tied to a bridge and going down to the water. All <br/>
that was left was to check the three bridges.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was wonderfully and diabolically complex. I had to create a <br/>
whole story about the Temple, and figure out how to make an underwater box <br/>
work. The carving was really nice -- a woman wearing a tunic, walking, and <br/>
blowing a large, long trumpet.<br/>
<br/>
FUN!!!<br/>

WNY ...<br/>
<br/>
Every year a group of friends and my family go camping<br/>
for a long weekend, somewhere in NY State.  We had<br/>
chosen Letchworth that year, as we had never been<br/>
there and wanted to check out the gorges.<br/>
<br/>
I had "recruited" a bunch of my buddies to go<br/>
letterboxing with.  So we start out with 6 adults, 2<br/>
kids under 5, and a terrier down into the gorge. <br/>
There was a forecast for scattered T-storms, but we<br/>
figured we could make it.  About 10 minutes into the<br/>
hike two of the adults decided it was getting to dark<br/>
and cloudy, and took their son back with them to our<br/>
campground.  But the rest of us (including the 5 year<br/>
old and the dog) continued on.<br/>
<br/>
About halfway to the box, the deluge began.  I can<br/>
honestly say that I would have been drier standing<br/>
under one of the waterfalls.  We got to the site, and<br/>
what was described in the clues as a "trickling<br/>
stream" looked more like the Mississippi.  But we<br/>
jumped over at the narrowest spot, built a tent of<br/>
raincoats, and stamped in.<br/>
<br/>
After the box was safely planted, we were going to<br/>
head back when one of the girls dropped her water<br/>
bottle into the "stream".  Like an idiot I dashed into<br/>
the stream, water up to my thighs, and retrieved the<br/>
bottles just before the went under a chain link fence<br/>
and down what looked like a 50' drop.  Needless to say<br/>
I backed out of there pretty darn quick.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we made it back to the campground, it had<br/>
stopped raining and we were all laughing hysterically.<br/>
 And believe it or not, we're all still<br/>
letterboxing!!!<br/>
