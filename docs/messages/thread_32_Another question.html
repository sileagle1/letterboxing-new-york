<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to boxing!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Alphabet Bandits have 3 series in the works... 
two partially planted and one in the carving stage.  Each one has a 
theme:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hudson Valley Alphabet has 26 stamps... each in 
a different type face and each representing a cool place to visit in the Hudson 
Valley... I - Indian Brook, P - Poet's Walk, etc.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In the I Love to Read Series each stamp is the 
main character from children's books... Junie B. Jones, The Littles, Cat in the 
Hat etc...</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The other is Legends of the Silver Screen and each 
stamp is a caricature of a film star... Lana Turner... Jimmy Stewart... John 
Wayne etc.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">None of our series have images that are directly 
related to the name of the place in which they are planted... and many of the 
ones we've gotten weren't either.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">How about a Veteran's series... maybe you could do 
a image to represent each of the major conflicts in which our soldiers have 
represented us... the US flag with 13 stars...the Pearl Harbor Memorial... 
should be relatively easy to carve.... a WWI helmet...  ... the images 
don't have to be similar, and the only one they need ot make sense to is 
you!  I think that would actully be a very nice series and would prompt 
people to visit all the parks.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I learned from our alphabet series, that I'd spent 
YEARS! driving past the most amazing places on my way to the most boring things

Well, having a father who is a WW2 vet and having served in the famous 101st<br/>
Airborne Divison, it would be very easy for our family to do a series for<br/>
vets - I would have my husband carve a screaming eagle for one and then for<br/>
the others I would do like another Lber suggested and have stamps that<br/>
represent other branches of the service or a stamp to represent each time we<br/>
were at war starting with the Revolution and including the Civil War  to<br/>
current.     We just finished a series of 4 Lb's on historical little out of<br/>
the way spots here in Madison County, NY and each of the stamps represents<br/>
what happened in that spot (well, except for one).  We have a lot of rich<br/>
Native American history in this county.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to be a witness to what AC said in his post.  We "built" a<br/>
vacation AROUND letterboxing in the states of VT, Mass, and NH and we saw<br/>
some of the GREATEST little out of the way spots that would NEVER show up on<br/>
a tour map or travel brochure but thanks to Lbers in the area, we saw and<br/>
learned some fantastic things!!!!  The best vacation we have had in a long<br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
Go for it!!!<br/>
