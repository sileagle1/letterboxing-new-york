<p class="ygrps-yiv-862977529MsoNormal">I’ve attended many gathering over the years and have
always been amazed at the varied and wonderful dishes boxers bring to the pot
luck table.  This weekend the star of the Winter Games: Box O’lympics
was Firestarter’s hot Mexican layered did, which turned out to the main
course for many of us.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-862977529MsoNormal"> <br/>
The Amazing Butternut Soup I had at Fright Night II and the dip (both of which
I cornered the maker for recipe) gave me an idea for a traveling event
box.  Do you have a favorite item that you like to make and bring to
gathers for the pot luck table?  If so e-mail me off list.  All you
need to do is send me the recipe with a little history as why you bring it or
why it represents where you live and carve a stamp to go along with the recipe. 
The recipes will be compiled into a booklet which will travel with the stamps
and be available to anyone who wants one.  I’d like to have recipes
from all over the country!  What do y’all bring to gathers down it
Texas?  How bouchas up in Minnesota EH?  Dude what’s cooking is
Callie?</p>

It's a cake you only make for special occassions or special people as it's pretty costly and time consuming.  I no longer live on Long Island, but still in New York State and make the care on rare occassions.  And/or I could make the I came up with myself for italian sausage links with potatoes, onions and green peppers that I use to take to a lot of pot lucks..  Yummy.  I just don't know how I'd make a stamp for that.</div> <div> </div> <div>I'm really curious as to how many recipes and stamps you would compile and what the cost of shipping them would be.  That
 might cause a problem for some people including me.  I figure postals into my budget and only have so much I can allow for this purpose.</div> <div> </div> <div>Well, I guess all we can do is wait and see what the response is.</div> <div> </div> <div>Grandma51 aka Shirley<br/><br/><b><i>AC &lt;cshouse@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1691648515replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1691648515ygrp-text"> <div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1691648515Section1"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1691648515MsoNormal">Hi All,</div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1691648515MsoNormal"></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1691648515MsoNormal">Ive attended many gathering over the years and have always been amazed at the varied and wonderful

I posted a question the other day and never received an answer.  I <br/>
guess I'll have to post it on AQ.  Anyway, for those of you who do <br/>
decide to read this I think the message below is a great idea.  I <br/>
guess everyone is busy and doesn't have the time for a recipe and <br/>
accompanying stamp.  I really do understand that, on the other hand a <br/>
lot of us are sitting sround on our hands trying to figure out what <br/>
stamp to carve next, ME.  Again, I'm sure I'm getting overly <br/>
enthusiastic, but I think this is a really cool idea.  Before this I <br/>
didn't even know there were traveling event stamps.  How fun to get a <br/>
stamp and a recipe to go along with it.  I have also tasted some <br/>
really good food at the one event I went to, but lots of other <br/>
potlucks and never got the oppotunity to ask for the recipe.  If <br/>
everyone I know and everyone they know sends in one recipe we could <br/>
write a cookbook.  That's my solicitation for today.  Give it some <br/>
thought.<br/>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>When you are learning to carve, there will be a LOT of
experimentation.  I’ve been boxing and carving since March of 2001,
and I still have to experiment.  In fact I’m doing 
positive/negative trial carve right now.  </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>The key to a good carve is a good original… unless a
drawing is line art (strictly black and white, no grey) I edit it in a graphics
program.  I use Adobe Photoshop CS2 (only because it’s the program I
happen to have).  You often have to play with an image to get something that
is crisp and has enough contrast and therefore is “carveable”. 
The hour it takes sometimes to manipulate an image to get a good original is
well worth the effort.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>Now, when you say carve negative, are  you looking for an
image where the white creates the image or the black?  I’ve created
a folder (talking turtle) in the pictures folder that has examples of
each.  The Sin City image is one I carved for Fright Night3.  Sin
City is a graphic novel in the Film Noir style, which lends itself nicely to
carving.  In both of these, the “white” was carved away. 
In the Sin City image, although the white is carved away, it’s actually
the white (or negative space) that creates the image.  Unlike the Disney image,
in which the white is also carved away, the black creates the image as in a
traditional stamp. </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>Using negative space to create a positive impression creates a
very dramatic stamp.  The stamps tend to be very simple images, that have
a lot of impact.  Orange Marilyn was the first stamp I ever saw that used
this technique. Although it creates a great image, too much of it can be a bad
thing.  These images benefit from an ultra crisp original and a steady
hand.  Otherwise the resulting image will look blurry.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>I will sometimes, invert an image to create an original like the
one used for Sin City, but not every one works well.  I have my fair share
of those as well.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-757959620MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'>I hope this at least in part answered your question, maybe you
can attend a carving demo in these parts (the Hudson Valley) one day!</span></p>

I'm sorry, folks...the Highlander and I have been in a small maelstrom<br/>
of personal events lately, the last of which was a car accident in the<br/>
town I teach in. I'm okay, but his neck is still in bad shape (worse<br/>
than before). I really have only been paying attention at AQ these<br/>
days (and even that's been spotty). I'm pretty sure we're not going to<br/>
DSS because I don't think his neck can take it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm not ignoring anyone, I'm just...hibernating, I think. Kev<br/>
and I are just taking solace in each other these days. BTW, Shirl,<br/>
your grandson's hair has been cut...I can see his FACE again! :-) I'm<br/>
really glad the 5th grade boys finally let go of the psuedo-Leif<br/>
Garrett look...they look SOOOO much...well, I can SEE them again!<br/>

it, but was doing it wrong and he showed me how to do it right. <br/>
That's the only lesson I had.  I am very creative at log books, but<br/>
still carving simple stamps.  <br/>

He's 10 and like me, he's overly sensitive. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; The 2nd stamp I planted was finished for me by Silver Dragon <br/>Quinn<br/>&gt; when we went to their house for the hostel they have. I had started<br/>&gt; it, but was doing it wrong and he showed me how to do it right. <br/>&gt; That's the only
 lesson I had. I am very creative at log books, but<br/>&gt; still carving simple stamps. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; AC &lt;cshouse@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Grandma,<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the support I haven't had many responses, but I'm<br/>&gt; going to begin to hit up my friends soon! Ahem.. Ahem paging <br/>Sprite<br/>&gt; anyone with the last name Quinn I'm confident it will come <br/>together. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I'm sorry you didn't get your question answered. It's hard to<br/>&gt; tell sometimes. I personally try NOT to reply to the list, but to <br/>the<br/>&gt; sender instead, to reduce some of the mail folks get. Ask your<br/>&gt; question again, I will do my best to answer it.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; TT<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; From: <a href="mailto:LbNY%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LbNY@yahoogroups. com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:LbNY%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LbNY@yahoogroups. com</a>] <br/>On<br/>&gt; Behalf Of casac14094<br/>&gt; &gt; -I
 have come to the conclusion that not many people resd this <br/>site.<br/>&gt; I posted a question the other day and never received an answer. If <br/>&gt; everyone I know and everyone they know sends in one recipe we could<br/>&gt; write a cookbook. That's my solicitation for today.
