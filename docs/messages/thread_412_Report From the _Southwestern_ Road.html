didn't turn out quite the way I planned as far as boxing, but we <br/>
still accomplished some things! We went down on Thanksgiving day and <br/>
cam back on Saturday, so we really had only Friday to box at all. <br/>
When we got there, I was so glad to see my family again that I <br/>
couldn't bring myself to zip out of the house early in the morning to <br/>
get boxes. My dad made a huge breakfast on Friday morning after he <br/>
got up around 11, so we didn't even get going until 1pm. <br/>
<br/>
Our plan was to hit the Highlander's favorite Mexican joint (Uncle <br/>
Julio's) after visiting one of the kids I practically raised, so we <br/>
headed out to McKinney, which strangely enough had NO letterboxes in <br/>
it! The girl I raised has grown in a beautiful, confident young woman <br/>
with a terrific husband (whom I also used to take care of) and a new <br/>
house that's she very proud of. So, needless to say, I turned them <br/>
BOTH into letterboxers (Flutter Puppy and the Stealth Wookie, for <br/>
those keeping track of newbie names!) and we decided to go find some <br/>
boxes. <br/>
<br/>
That was when I realized I had left my trail stamp at my parents's <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
By that point, we were running out of time. We had to meet up with <br/>
another one of my kids at the restaurant (and replace our box that <br/>
had gone missing from there), then the Highlander had promised to <br/>
make venison chili for my folks, so we had to go to the store and <br/>
then get the chili started before dinner, which was about 3 hours <br/>
away...and we were already at least an hour from home. So, instead of <br/>
searching for boxes, we planted one of my retired PLBs that I had <br/>
wanted to place in McKinney (what better place for KC and the <br/>
Sunshine Band than a place with LOTS of sunshine!), went to Uncle <br/>
Julio's and put out the new box before lunch and went home filled <br/>
with margarita swirls and good will towards men!<br/>
<br/>
So, not quite the boxing tour de force I had hoped for (2 boxes <br/>
planted and 0 found), but strangely enough, a very satisfying holiday <br/>
weekend!<br/>
