that's cause I'm in MA and haven't yet attended any NY gatherings.  I<br/>
have certainly met plenty of people as a result of being a member of<br/>
my local letterbox group (LbNE) though.<br/>
<br/>
I still check the LbNY board from time to time, though for two reasons:<br/>
1.  MA isn't that far from NY, and I could pick up some of the boxes<br/>
in the eastern part of the state.<br/>
2.  Western NY is my home and I will have occasion to 'box there and,<br/>
if the timing is right, attend a NY gathering.<br/>

Best,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Paul, for me that's a little hard to sort out at this<br/>
point, I've met a number of LBNY folks thru events<br/>
that were posted here and on AQ - I read both.  This<br/>
board is def more active but I usually read the events<br/>
info on AQ.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm not sure how many we can say we met solely 
because of New York Yahoo Groups, but I'm pretty sure all the Finger Lakes gang 
were people we met through Yahoo (except Crafymouse and Dan, who I think we met 
at the first WNY event, but I can't recall). We only knew one WNY person 
(RocNRon) at the Finger Lakes gathering this summer and one LbON person 
(Jiggs),  so I figure that's more than 15 right there!</font></div>
