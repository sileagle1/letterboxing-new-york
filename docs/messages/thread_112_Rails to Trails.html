HA!! The fingers ... until I finally discovered the error I kept
repeating, it took me four try's to locate the Pinkie. And, I contra
dance every weekend in the city where the Thumb is, I know just about
exactly where to look, but still haven't been able to leave home early
enough to find it before the dance. Maybe this weekend after the time
change I'll see if it's still there.<br/>

reality sets in and you have trouble finding a box or two, so in <br/>
essence, you get about 3, maybe 4 good hours in, but no more than <br/>
that in a day. Think about the 19 boxes at the Ravine...those are <br/>
fairly close together and that STILL takes a good 2 hours. Imagine <br/>
them spaced FURTHER apart and that'll be when you start finding our <br/>
bodies on the trail, one hand stretched toward <br/>
that...elusive...second...box...(gasps the final gasp and is still).<br/>
<br/>
10 miles of walking alone will make this into a few trips for sure, <br/>
expecially if your clues get trickier as you go. It's a neat idea, <br/>
but definitely not a daytrip! :-)<br/>

finally gave up figuring we just weren't meant to find it that trip.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other series boxes go. The only series we've ever even <br/>
tried to do in one day was the Seal Town Boxes in CA 8 boxes all in <br/>
one town and walking distance. A LONG walk. We ended up taking 2 days <br/>
for that. Now we just plan on 1 or 2 boxes a day. So we'd probably <br/>
look on the way to Rome and then on the way out. Might take us a <br/>
couple of trips but that's ok too. LOL<br/>

There are porta-pottys in the parks and picnic areas along the trails.<br/>

and I have permission to include references to their boxes in my<br/>
directions.  I don't tell you where the boxes are, I simply mention<br/>
that such and such park is another mile down the road which is the<br/>
starting place for "Click-here" letterbox.<br/>

</span></blockquote>That *can* be done in one day???  I'd just assumed it would require a<br/>
weekend.  I sorta figured if I don't make it to Pennsic, that would be<br/>
my next choice.<br/>
