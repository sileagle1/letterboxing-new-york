                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1309382338">Well, the 4th Annual WNY Gathering is over and only NOW am I soaking <br/>
wet! The promised rain only hit when we were all packing up to leave <br/>
this morning, so we avoided a weekend full of squishy shoes and damp <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The day event went as laid-backedly (new word!) as they always do <br/>
upstate...lots of folks hanging out stamping and eating and <br/>
exchanging without the intensity you might find elsewhere. Frankly, <br/>
it's like a family reunion, even with our new folks...and the list of <br/>
first time gatherers was enormous! I got to meet tons of folks I had <br/>
only chatted with online for the first time and was really glad to <br/>
mix it up with them.<br/>
Our farthest guests came from CT, (Bluebird &amp; Music Woman), PA <br/>
(Cyclonic), Canada (just can't keep the Jiggs Clan away!) :-) and new <br/>
friends from Ohio (Pioneer Spirit and Lady Dove). Unfortunately, the <br/>
Highlander never made it to the event (had a long day of <br/>
certification testing that he never woke up from Saturday night), but <br/>
he was there in Sprite...er, spirit! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The night boxing seemed to go pretty well, too. I didn't have as many <br/>
boxes as I would have liked, but the idea of night boxing was enough <br/>
for all of us to be excited about. The camping out was a blast in and <br/>
of itself...can't believe how much fun we had just hanging around <br/>
talking! Without the Highlander around, I was glad to have so many <br/>
folks around to hang out with (plus I was THRILLED to find a cadre a <br/>
letterboxing GAMERS to play some late night D &amp; D on Saturday...power <br/>
to the geek!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the next event is already posted on Atlas Quest <br/>
(<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=221)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=221)</a>, so we <br/>
hope to continue the trend of one big happy family next <br/>
summer...thanks to everyone for making this event a wonderful <br/>
experience!<br/>

home) Highlander</div>
