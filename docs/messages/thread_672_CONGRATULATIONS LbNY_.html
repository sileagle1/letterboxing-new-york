<br/>
When I started the group in July 2004, we were a tiny group of only <br/>
10 members, and since then, we've grown to a whopping 130 members! <br/>
This group is now almost as big as LbNCA, the group I belong to in <br/>
Northern California, which has been in existence for a much longer <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I now see boxes the have been planted in many new areas that didn't <br/>
have a single one in 2004 or 2005. And many of you participate in <br/>
gatherings in the state, which I hear are successful and a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Since I only visit once or twice a year, I don't get to do as much <br/>
letterboxing in NY as I'd like. But I do manage to find some boxes in <br/>
central NY where my family lives. It makes me feel good to know that <br/>
starting this group was a great idea, since it's brought so many <br/>
people together for a wonderfully fun activity that beats sitting in <br/>
front of the TV all the time!<br/>
<br/>
High Five to everyone in LbNY!<br/>
<br/>
When visiting and leaving your heart in San Francisco, be sure to <br/>
hunt for a couple of my boxes, too!<br/>

boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I am having fun letterboxing, but unfortunately, I don't have enough <br/>
time to get around to as many boxes as I'd like. We've been focusing <br/>
on the Oneida, NY area, which has so many boxes I've nearly been <br/>
tripping over them every time I take a STEP!<br/>
<br/>
To LbNY members: Just a friendly reminder to consider a couple of <br/>
things when you're planting:<br/>
<br/>
1. Be mindful of placing boxes in poison ivy area. I'm lucky -- I'm <br/>
immune to it, but a couple of boxes were smack in the middle of the <br/>
itchy stuff, so my family couldn't go to the boxes and had to send me <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
2. Boxes planted on steep slopes without anything strong keeping them <br/>
from sliding downhill will most likely get washed away in heavy <br/>
rains. I noticed some boxes that were in danger of that, or were now <br/>
missing because of that.<br/>
<br/>
Since you put so much work in on planting a box, don't place in <br/>
vulnerable spots or places where folks won't go.<br/>
<br/>
** I'd like to tip my hat to Party Pig and friends for their numerous <br/>
boxes planted in the area. Lock Wench, you've set a tough standard <br/>
for numbers of boxes, but it looks like others have been inspired by <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I have to leave so soon, I could keep myself busy planting &amp; <br/>
finding for many weeks here. I planted one box so far, "Webber at the <br/>
Parkway", listed on AtlasQuest, and I have one more parting farewell <br/>
box that I'm hiding today titled, "Eltrey" -- so that I leave a bit <br/>
of legacy behind.<br/>
<br/>
In my home territory of San Francisco, I'm ready to plant a set <br/>
of "Cabinet of Curiosities" boxes that are very unusual with extra <br/>
big stamps and unique containers, hoping to get yet more "diamond <br/>
gem - Highly Recommended" icons on AtlasQuest. If you visit, look for <br/>
them, as well as my other favorites: "Star-Crossed" and "Dias de los <br/>
Muertos".<br/>
<br/>
Ciao, folks!<br/>
