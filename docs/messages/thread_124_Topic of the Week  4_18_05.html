<div><tt><font color="#000000">Hi CNY boxers,<br/>
<br/>
Here's this week's topic:<br/>
<br/>
**************************************************<br/>
TOPIC OF THE WEEK<br/>
<br/>
How well do you hide your boxes?  This is not a joke.  For
example do you do something like putting a hand full of forest floor
debris on top of the box before the rocks and then another covering of
debris and leaves?<br/>
<br/>

Have fun!</font></tt></div>

<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I have been buying cheap silk leaves, 
mostly ivy-looking-ish, and hot gluing them to the lid and sides of the box. 
This helps a lot in most instances in giving me hiding options. I figure that as 
they age and discolor, they'll still work as camouflage. One youngster, upon 
finding my 'Star-Crossed' box with his mother, remarked, "Wow, Mom! Look -- he 
used salad"!</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You can make faux rock surfaces using 
Granitex, or Premo or Sculpey polymer clay, and embedding dirt and small 
pebbles into the clay. The surfaces have to be baked separately and then hot or 
super-glued on to the letterbox to avoid melting the plastic box during 
baking. The legendary letterboxer, Sir Balthazar, gave me one of his faux 
hollow rocks that he makes using some industrial materials and are 
time-consuming to make. I think Granitex polymer clay works as well, if not 
better, than what he used (his broke on me). He hadn't thought of using polymer 
clay. You could make 1 or 2 good hollow rock molds to create any number of 'faux 
rock boxes' from, and keep them on hand. Sir Balthazar has a faux rock 
box that's been in plain view for years and hasn't been discovered by 
the public. If you want more info on making molds, let me know &amp; I'll 
refer you to some good polymer clay technique books.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I like to hot glue enough wire onto 
the box to allow it to be attached to things more spontaneously on the spot. It 
works well for stabilizing and increases your hiding options greatly. You can 
then attach the box by wiring it onto the back of signs, branches of trees, etc. 
Use a wire that won't rust - or is plastic coated.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">One last really unique and totally 
fantastic idea that I found on a box in Long Beach, CA, but never tried. This 
box's hiding spot was a piece of black PVC drainage pipe that had some sort of 
lidded cover that fit perfectly over it. It stood upwards, coming out of the 
soil, and placed under some landscaping foliage near the side of a building, it 
really looked like something functional for drainage or plumbing. No one would 
question it at all. Very easy to access and replace -- and it scores a full 5 
star rating for clever disguise!</font></strong></div>
