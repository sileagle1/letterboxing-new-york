stamps.  Went out today, scouted the area, and placed the neccesities <br/>
close at hand. This box(s) will be in Waterloo, NY in memory of <br/>
Memorial Day which started out there.  (Can't believe no one beat me <br/>
to this one)  Hoping others will be planting too.  LW (YOU RULE) <br/>
prolly been planning this day for the last few weeks.  I can't tell <br/>
any more WO counting but as of last week NY was only behind CT by <br/>
about 350 boxes.  When are we gonna catch them. Gotta ask GT why he <br/>
changed that part of the site.  It's still possible to get boxes for <br/>
the entire state but they are not numbered abymore. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace &amp; Balance<br/>
Happy boxing to all and to all a good hike</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1483066614">Great job, PB!  Yes, I have noticed that New York is quickly catching <br/>
up to CT. CT will probably always have the distinction of "Most <br/>
letterboxes per square mile" but I am so proud of the work of  NY <br/>
boxers. Especially Scout in the southern tier and the Wizards of Oz i <br/>
n the north! Today I went to FINALLY place the Howland Island Box, <br/>
Tall Tails  (awhile ago I had hiked in the 2 miles then realized I had <br/>
left the box in the car. Not wanting to walk a total of 8 miles for <br/>
that one plant alone, I decided to come back another day) and was <br/>
thinking about how a certain talented boxer told me she was thinking <br/>
of planting a series in the area. WHich is great...at 3,100 <br/>
acres..there is plenty of room!<br/>
<br/>
Then I went to spend some time FINDING and chose to do Craftymouse's <br/>
series of Accidental birds at Esker Brook. I have a box here too so I <br/>
could do a little maintenance as well. Well, what a fantastic series! <br/>
I don't know ANYONE who carves birds better than Craftymouse. The <br/>
detail is amazing. And her handmade logbooks make me green with envy. <br/>
If you haven't done this series yet, I highly suggest it. Between her <br/>
5 boxes and my one...you could get 6 boxes in a lovely 1.5 mile walk. <br/>
AnAnd there is always so much wildlife here. I have seen families of <br/>
rabbits and white tail deer...as well as all the lovely birds.<br/>
<br/>
Nice job, Craftymouse!<br/>
