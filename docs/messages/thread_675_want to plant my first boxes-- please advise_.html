<br/>
I'm a docent (volunteer) at the Utica Zoo, and there aren't any letter<br/>
boxes planted within the zoo property.  However, I think it would be a<br/>
great place to plant some boxes!  However, there is a fee to get into<br/>
the zoo, and I'm wondering if it's still OK to plant boxes somewhere<br/>
if you have to pay to get in.  What's the proper etiquette?  I know<br/>
there are boxes planted at state parks, and most of the time, you have<br/>
to pay to go there, so paying to get into the zoo, when you can make a<br/>
day of it AND letter box, doesn't seem too outrageous to me.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciate!  And yes, I am planning on<br/>
talking to the zoo director and any/all zoo keepers that would be<br/>
responsible for maintaining the areas in which the boxes would be planted.<br/>

If you really want to put it inside the zoo, then clearly state that <br/>
there's a fee involved, and you might want to include the zoo's hours <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1763940398">Most definately plant in the zoo!!! I think there are<br/>
other zoo boxes around NY (I know of at least one in<br/>
Ross Park Zoo in Binghamton, but it's not in the zoo<br/>
proper itself).  If you log your letterbox on<br/>
Atlasquest, there's an icon you can include that shows<br/>
it's hidden in a fee area.  And if you put it in your<br/>
clues, then people can decide for themselves if they<br/>
want to pay to get in to get it or not.  Personally, I<br/>
have no problems paying an entrance fee to something<br/>
if I can get a letterbox.  It would make a great<br/>
family trip<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2034297627">Several years ago our family visited Longwood Gardens in PA.  In the<br/>
main conservatory they had a "letterbox" hunt (un be knownst to them<br/>
though).  I think that with the permission of the zoo staff it would<br/>
be a great asset.  It could be used as an educational opportunity and<br/>
it would get people to the zoo ( $$ admission - good for the zoo).  I<br/>
know there are some people who will do anything to get a find.<br/>
At the conservatory (it was aimed at children) you could pick up a<br/>
flyer that talked about six different plants.  You needed to walk<br/>
around this HUGE greenhouse looking for the correct plant and then<br/>
when you found it stamp in.  It would be nice if the seeker had to<br/>
learn something about the animals at the zoo in order to find the<br/>
stamp. While finding boxes is fun, I love the puzzle aspect of some of<br/>
the clues.<br/>
Hope this helps and hope to see some boxes at the zoo soon.<br/>
