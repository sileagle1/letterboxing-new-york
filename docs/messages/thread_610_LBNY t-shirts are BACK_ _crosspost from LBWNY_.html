                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1744013892">Okay, we're about to do another round of the LBNY t-shirts (see <br/>
attached pic for the logo)! The cost is $11 if you can pick your <br/>
shirt up from our place in Medina within two weeks of the shirts <br/>
coming. If not, we'll mail them to you in a priority flat rate <br/>
envelope for an extra $4.05 (or if you want the box for more shirts, <br/>
$8.10). Just send the money via Paypal to our regular e-mail address <br/>
(contact us offlist if you don't know it already). Be sure to include <br/>
the number of shirts you want and the sizes (Adult S-XXL only). <br/>
<br/>
If you've already sent us an e-mail telling us what size you wanted <br/>
and where you live, we've got it, so just send the Paypal payment <br/>
with info to confirm (I'll post a list of whom we already have on our <br/>
list once I get my laptop running again). If you didn't give us info, <br/>
just send us the money and info via Paypal, anyway and we'll add you <br/>
to the list. We can't place the order until everyone's paid, so if we <br/>
haven't gotten payment from you by the end of October, we'll have to <br/>
drop your order and let you in on the next round. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you soon!<br/>
