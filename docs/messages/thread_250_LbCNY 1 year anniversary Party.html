so much fun meeting and talking to everyone....plotting things to <br/>
come.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Someone must have called in and ordered the weather because it was <br/>
perfect, especially hunting certain special boxes like "Splash".  My <br/>
favorite clue was canapes, which led to the most fun box "The _ _ _ _ <br/>
_ _ _, the Baker, the Candlestick Maker".  What I can't believe is <br/>
that after spending all that time together, somehow I missed <br/>
exchanging with MTnestRobin.  Arrrrgh!<br/>
<br/>
Aah, my traveling companions.  :-)  Lock Wench and LisaScenic must <br/>
have breathed a sigh of relief when the ride was over.... after our <br/>
near close encounter with the car that decided, rather than use the <br/>
on ramp for what it was designed for, to stop instead.  Do they dare <br/>
get in the car with me again....Hmm???<br/>
<br/>
Paul, you and your family are wonderful, you guys are truly blessed.<br/>
Remember, next year 2 weeks.<br/>
:-)<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

ps. Even though I'm a Red Sox fan I'll still cheer for Butter Bean.</div>
