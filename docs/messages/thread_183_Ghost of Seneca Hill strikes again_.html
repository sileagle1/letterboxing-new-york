A storm must have struck the Riverside Cemetery in the past few <br/>
days. We received word that the giant tree to the left of the tree <br/>
that's hosting the letterbox had fallen over right on top of the <br/>
tree with box. We checked it out last night and decided to remove <br/>
the box until clean-up is complete in the area. It shouldn't be too <br/>
long, although that was one MASSIVE tree that fell, and it's <br/>
currently resting on top of the other tree. It's also in danger of <br/>
falling and destroying several very large and important headstones. <br/>
<br/>
We think the Ghost is letting us know that SHE KNOWS about her <br/>
letterbox. How interesting that the only tree in the entire cemetery <br/>
to take a fall during a storm should happen to land right where we <br/>
planted a letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
The creepiness factor for this box just went up!<br/>
<br/>
We'll post again when we've replanted. There may be a little <br/>
something extra in regards to this box at that time. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a shout-out to WINK for letting us know about our Ghost: <br/>
Duuude! You're our hero!!!! Long live the Wizards of Oz!<br/>
