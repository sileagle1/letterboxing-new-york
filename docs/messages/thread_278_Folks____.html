I can dig all these thoughts that are comming out, but............<br/>
I need to voice my opinion.  I love us all, I do.  I think we are <br/>
looking beyond what we need to.  We should think as a group.<br/>
We're all on the same team.  If it said "LB-MARS" or "LB-Jupiter" we <br/>
should all be "in" if we like the shirt.  We're all gonna get those <br/>
boxes on those planets anyhow (We just need to figure out how to get <br/>
there).  My point is.......Who really cares what it says, as long as <br/>
it's a cool shirt (which it is).  Just my two cents......I think we're <br/>
splitting hairs about an artist's work.<br/>
We can't always fit stuff to our needs and wants.  Nobody is try'n ta <br/>
show-up another area or group.  We're all here to have love and boxes!<br/>
<br/>
                        Loving life.....<br/>
