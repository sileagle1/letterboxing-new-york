                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-296346481">Okay, Celtic Quinn and I are planting boxes tomorrow (August 15th) at<br/>
Chestnut Ridge Park. We're planting all the ones we have and have<br/>
received, but since neither of us is done carving as of this posting,<br/>
we MIGHT make another trip down this weekend. If you have one that you<br/>
plan to send us, write us IMMEDIATELY and mail the box so it gets here<br/>
by SATURDAY the 18th. Anything that doesn't show up by then will be on<br/>
the table for the gathering and planted afterward.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, if we can't keep it (as a permanent plant), we don't want<br/>
it! Not being rude or nasty, but the plan is to seed this park pretty<br/>
heavily so it'll be a boxer's paradise; plus, the park's pretty far<br/>
away for those of us in the northern part of WNY, so we won't be going<br/>
back unless ABSOLUTELY necessary (maintenance and such).<br/>
<br/>
More bulletins as warranted!<br/>
