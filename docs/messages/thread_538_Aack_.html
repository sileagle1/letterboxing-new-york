Oswego! D'oh! We haven't had much time for boxing lately. In fact, I <br/>
don't think we've been anywhere since Kingston. Stupid things keep <br/>
getting in the way. You know, like house-remodeling, jobs, family, <br/>
blah blah blah! Can't they see I'm trying to get out and letterbox?!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. I STILL haven't replaced the 2 Dandelion's Ducks boxes that <br/>
were missing/pulled. I also have to replace the Port City of CNY box, <br/>
since the sign is finally back up. I've got loads of boxes to place, <br/>
but just haven't had the time to get out there and find a good spot! <br/>

Soon....soon.<br/>
