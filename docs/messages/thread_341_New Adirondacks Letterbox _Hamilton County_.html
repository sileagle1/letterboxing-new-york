<div>Anyone planning to take a drive up to the Adirondacks this fall to see the spectacular fall foliage show, don't forget to letterbox! I just got back from camping in the Inlet area and there are a bunch of great boxes up there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I brought my carving material and some box supplies and planted a letterbox just north of Inlet.  Here's a link to the clues...</div>

<div>I bagged 5 letterboxes in the Inlet-Eagle Bay area alone... they were fabulous and the dogs loved the easy hikes (Lucy is now healed and the doctor gave her the a-ok to go hiking, so off we went!). :o)</div>

<br/>
I can't WAIT to head up to the Adirondacks. I have some boxes to <br/>
plant and now I will have to get your box on the way! <br/>
<br/>
I must confess that my seasons are a bit mixed right now. At noon <br/>
today I finished the last of my homemade french onion soup that I <br/>
made when the nights got down to the 40's around here. But I ate it <br/>
while sitting on a deck by a swimming pool and dressed in my bathing <br/>
suit! We got home this evening and it was much cooler so I changed <br/>
into jeans and a sweater while my son asked me if we could have a <br/>
fire in the fireplace after we finished cooking on the grill. It's <br/>
hard to plan what to wear, what to eat, etc. lol<br/>
<br/>
This summer was truly glorious for those of us in NYS, eh? I can't <br/>
remember a nicer summer...even though there were over 20 days in the <br/>
90's! I, for one, am happy the cool nights are back.<br/>
