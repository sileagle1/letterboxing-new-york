Actually, all of my New York boxes are relatively near each other.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I'm back in California for the next nine months, I'm wonderng<br/>
how my "kids" are....<br/>
<br/>
Robb and I are off to San Francisco, for a boxing frenxy.  We did a<br/>
twenty-ish mile bike ride yesterday.  We added a box to his San<br/>
Francisco Bay Trail series.  Just as a side note:   Robb is a maniac!<br/>
 He takes box camoflage to a really demented extreme!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is well in the Empire State!<br/>

<div>I will be sure to give you status reports for all of yours that I find. Missing you already but know that you'll be actively seeding the West Coast. *grin*</div>

Robb and I continued our letterboxing frenzy today, and found Paul in<br/>
SF's beautiful Star-Crossed and Ortus Depths.  Fake ivy is not safe<br/>
around this man!  The books in Star Crossed were great.  I loved the<br/>
comments of the person who was cursing the over-abundance of wedding,<br/>
wedding planners, and wedding photographers in this spot.<br/>
<br/>
We found a few of Princess Lea's boxes (she put me up to hiding The<br/>
Mystery of Mirror Bay in Cooperstwon), and failed to find some others.<br/>
<br/>
We saw Tamsyn and Chili Boy's stamps at Columba, and then felt like<br/>
big dopes when we got home and realized that we hadn't double-checked<br/>
that location on letterboxing.org.  Seems there are two stamps in that<br/>
location.  Duuuuuh.<br/>
<br/>
See, I can find connnections between Central New York letterboxing,<br/>
and letterboxing in the Bay Area.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care, Y'all.<br/>
