<div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm forwarding (with permission) something that was sent to me
the other day that may have an impact on our letterboxing way of life
in the future. There are 7 pages of discussion on the groundspeak.com
forum (the first link) and it looks like NYS is, with limitations and
restriction, accepting geocaching.  Personally I think it's only
a matter of time before they look at and regulate us.  Should we
do anything, what should we do, how will we respond? </div>
<div><br/></div>

possibility of secreting those illusive WOM  boxes with clues that <br/>
are hard to get one's  hands on (read: not posted on line for NYS <br/>
Park officials, et al, to access) in various NYS parks a la the way <br/>
the game is played very successfully, I might add, on <br/>
f*e*d*e*r*a*l*l*y owned properties. With the large number of NYS <br/>
Parks and NYS being a comparatively nascent entry into North American <br/>
letterboxingdom, New York could be a hotbed of WOM <br/>
letterboxes,certainly an interesting regional twist to the game <br/>
compared to published box rich surrounding states like CT, MA, PA and <br/>
OH. But this is prolly just wishful thinking on my part.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, there is really no action to take when it appears <br/>
the sky is falling on others as in the geocachers. By being *pro-<br/>
active* and bringing up questions about how these regulations might <br/>
impact letterboxing draws unwarranted and unwanted attention to the <br/>
game by bureaucratic talking heads who perhaps previously didn't even <br/>
know it existed or at least never found the need to *regulate* it <br/>
while it was unobtrusively taking place under their noses. <br/>
<br/>
If new or proposed NYS Park regulations clearly apply to geocaching <br/>
only, then the geocachers will have to deal with those <br/>
regulations...or not. If and when the regulations apply to <br/>
letterboxing specifically and then go on on to impose the same or <br/>
different regulations on letterboxing specifically, then letterboxers <br/>
can choose to comply..or not, or they can attempt to demonstrate to <br/>
disinterested bureaucrats whatever differences they can come up with <br/>
between letterboxing and geocaching and try to engage some change to <br/>
regulations vis a vis letterboxing or they can quietly engage in the <br/>
above-mentioned civil disobedience and keep their clues and boxes WOM <br/>
(and placed thoughtfully, of course) and off the radar screen.  <br/>

already 'regulated' us.  Note the following paragraph. <br/>
<br/>
     "Multi-caches leave clues to find the next site, eventually<br/>
leading to a cache.  Multi-caches will be limited to a total of five<br/>
(5) sites, but require only one permit.  However, since the potential<br/>

<br/>
Hiding plastic containers in the woods that require clues to find? <br/>
Can you say 'letterboxing'?  The difference between geocaching and<br/>
letterboxing may be far too subtle a distinction for them to bother<br/>
with.  If it's a plastic container in the woods, it's a geocache and<br/>
needs a permit.<br/>

 I have already attended several 'work-party' gatherings to help<br/>

trail manager.  He said it's not his cup of tea, but if it brings more<br/>
people to use the trails, he's all for it.  I'm currently writing<br/>
articles for the R2T newsletter.  After I get a couple of letterboxes<br/>
actually planted, I'm going to write an article on letterboxing for<br/>
the newsletter and ask that letterboxing be listed on the webpage as a<br/>
