I am a letterboxer from England and I am looking to exchange personal <br/>
stamps with letterboxers worldwide.  To be exact I am wanting to swap <br/>
the "inked impression" of the stamp and not the stamp itself!<br/>
I already have a collection of over 100 international personal stamps <br/>
and personally owned letterboxes and wish to add to my collection.<br/>
If anyone is interested in this idea then please do not hesitate to <br/>
contact me either on or off list.<br/>

I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>

<div>Hi Andy,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Things are just beginning to return to normal around here... Grandma 
has gone back home and I'm deprogramming the kids.... Hugh sends his reagards 
and we'd like to thank you for all your help out on the tors.  We had such 
a great time, and can't wait for the next trip in 3 years!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have lot's of stamps I'd like to trade... I just want to make sure I 
understand... you are collecting impressions of both personal stamps and stamps 
from boxes we've planted?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If so, I can send you 100 or so right off the bat... We have 3 series, 2 
partially planted and one in the works.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Alphabet Series is intersting places in the Hudson Valley (the of NY in 
which we live) --12 of 26 planted</div>
<div>I Love to Read Series - images based on our favorite children's books -- 4 
of 10 planted</div>
<div>and </div>
<div>Silver Screen Legends I'm still in the process of carving the stamps, but 
it will be 50 caricatures of great actors and actresses.  I'll be done by 
the end of next week 5 of 50 carved none planted yet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Send me your adress and I'll post them as soon as I'm done.</div>
