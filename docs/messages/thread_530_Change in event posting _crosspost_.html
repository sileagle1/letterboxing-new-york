the overnighters and the daytrippers. I've got the event details posted <br/>
at AQ, so check it out: <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?</a><br/>
gEventId=102 has the overnight event and <br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=171" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=171</a> has the <br/>
Saturday event only. I'd like to try and get us all in the A loop for <br/>
camping, somewhere in sites 15-32, so if you can make your reservations <br/>
now, DO so at the website I listed (and don't wait...the sites go fast <br/>
in summer!). <br/>
<br/>
Note: If you only plan on staying for the day, do NOT sign up for the <br/>
overnight event (or take yourself off the list for the night event). I <br/>
need to know how many people are going to stay before we try setting up <br/>
a night boxing event! IF you ARE staying, you can sign up for both, but <br/>
at LEAST sign up for the night one. They actually have separate event <br/>
stamps!)<br/>
