<div>Oh Rabbit, isn't it disappointing! :o( I started planting in the spring, and all of my multi-series boxes have had individual boxes vandalized, smashed, or missing. So much time goes into the carving and assembling of the box... it really is aggravating. Most of my vandalized/missing boxes have been, I come to realize, because I planted them in too "obvious" a location or too close to a trail, or in a manicured area where the box was bound to be found by the groundsman... whoops! Ah well, you live- you learn, I guess.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I pulled all of my boxes for the winter (except for my new mystery boxes and my Adirondack box) and told myself that under no uncertain terms was I to carve any more stamps until I re-carved the missing stamps from my vandalized series! :o) So I am pleased to say that all my series will be planted in the spring, full and intact (plus several new series, of course!). :o) </div>

<div>Here's to a 2006 of safe and well-hidden letterboxes, LOL! </div>
