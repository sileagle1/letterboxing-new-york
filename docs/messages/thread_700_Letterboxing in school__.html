<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello everyone!  I just thought I'd let you 
all know about a project I'm trying to get started in my daughter's 
school.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Every year our elementary school has a program 
called PARP (Parents As Reading Partners).  This year I am trying to get 
the principal to include letterboxing in this event.  I am supposed to meet 
with her tomorrow.  I thought that it would be a great way to introduce the 
children to letterboxing in an environment that they are comfortable with.  
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Here's the idea...each classroom would choose a 
book to base their clues on.  The other classes would have to read said 
book to decipher the clues.  Letterboxes would be hidden within the school 
building and school grounds.  (ex. if a class used "The Very Hungry 
Catipillar" the letterbox might be hidden in the cafeteria.)  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have spoken to a few teacher's who are all 
excited about the idea.  Many of them are going to be checking out 
letterboxing.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Any ideas?  suggestions?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'll let you know if it all works out, if the 
school agrees....and also what kind of response we get.</font></div>

one.  Please DON'T!  For every person that "gets" it, you'll have 5 <br/>
more that don't (at least!).  And the ones that don't ruin it for the <br/>
rest of us.  <br/>
<br/>
The activity you should try is Questing.  It's almost identical to <br/>
letterboxing, except that it is based on the idea of teaching people <br/>
more about their community.<br/>
<br/>
Check out this website:  <br/>
www.vitalcommunities.org/ValleyQuest/ValleyQuest.htm<br/>
<br/>
There is an excellent book, "Questing" by Delia Clark and Steven <br/>
Glazer that is basically a tutorial on how to set this up.  It's one <br/>
of the best books I've ever found for creative ideas for clue <br/>
writing.</div>

<div><font size="2">I'm afraid I have to agree with gslbbbanda. Letterboxing is not meant to be a project for a class of little kids. It's hard enough to maintain the specialness and uniqueness of what started out as a wonderful, creative gem of a hobby that spread by word of mouth to the talented and creative individuals who "got it". The huge amount of publicity it has received in articles such as the one in Family magazine bring hoards of people who are turning into a run of the mill, white bread little hobby they think is cute. Please make it a treasure hunt and call it a treasure hunt. Please don't bring more publicity to this hobby than we already have. I know you mean well, but........</font></div>
