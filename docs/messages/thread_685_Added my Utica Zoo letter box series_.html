                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-769086756">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I was planning on adding maybe three or four letter boxes up at the<br/>
Utica Zoo.  Welllllll. . .I was overly ambitious and added 12!  Yes,<br/>
it's true. . . my first planted letter boxes and there are twelve of<br/>
them!  You can search for them on either Atlas Quest or LB.org, either<br/>
one.  I am hoping families will have a BALL with these, as there are<br/>
clues to figure out which animal will be on the stamp, and all stamps<br/>
are hidden near the animals they represent at the zoo.  Most of the<br/>
employees at the zoo know where the letter boxes are, and everyone<br/>
thinks it's a great idea to get more people to visit our zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped me with ideas, carving, etc., along the<br/>
way.  I will be at the zoo periodically, so hopefully I'll catch up<br/>
with some of you while you're searching for the boxes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am not good with moderation, as you can see!  :D<br/>
<br/>
I still have to get over to the Cursed Coin box.  Oh. . .and I tried<br/>
to find your "sinking" box today and even with a hint from Dee, I<br/>
couldn't find it.  We tried twice, too!  She's going to check it out<br/>
this week and see if it's missing or if I'm just missing it!<br/>
<br/>
And hooray-- my first finders of the box logged in today!  A family of<br/>
four.  .I'm so proud!<br/>
