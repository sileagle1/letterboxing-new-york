Today my family and I found our last Oneida County box, The Place of <br/>
Nettles.  I guess that means we have to place one now.  We have a lot of <br/>
good ideas, but have never carved a stamp.  Hopefully we will get to <br/>
that soon.  This week we are camping on Raquette Lake and will try to <br/>
find that box.<br/>

manager at Michael's to carry the Speedball stamp carving supplies (they<br/>
used to, but stopped). I'll try to find &amp; post the links of a couple of<br/>
places where you can order supplies. Instructions on carving are on<br/>
www.letterboxing.org, and it's kind of addictive, you get better with each<br/>
stamp you do.<br/>
<br/>
I planted a box today that is my best stamp to date - it's of Shakespeare's<br/>
Juliet. It's about 4 1/4" square, split down the middle, and hinged with<br/>
duct tape, so it folds. I made a Popsicle stick brace which slides in to two<br/>
loops, so it holds it open while you stamp. This was an experiment that<br/>
worked, and allows me to use larger stamps and still keep my boxes small<br/>
enough to hide.<br/>
<br/>
I'm jealous! I love Raquette Lake...<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that there will soon be more Oneida County boxes (and maybe<br/>
Herkimer County boxes). Congratulations on completing the full set to date!<br/>
