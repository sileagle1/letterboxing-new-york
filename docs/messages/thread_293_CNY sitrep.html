                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-306068854">Just got back from vacation across NYS.  Went to visit MIL in Syracuse<br/>
on 8/12.  Found "@ Cat" (First finder!), The "Wonders" of Onondaga<br/>
Park (And I nearly busted a gut laughing when I found the first box. <br/>
I won't give away the joke, but it's worth the hunt just for the<br/>
joke!) [all 3 found and final puzzle solved], made an attempt at "Your<br/>
Ad Here" but the building closed before I found it.  Made an attempt<br/>
at "Trio of Visually Impaired Rodents" but discovered the entire area<br/>
being bulldozed and re-landscaped and gave them up as a loss without<br/>
even trying to find them.  Went after "I Never Strike the Same Place<br/>
Twice" and found only the first two.  The first one was a challenge<br/>
because there were fishermen all over the spot.  I took out my stamp<br/>
book, sat down and pretended to be sketching.  I slithered along on my<br/>
butt, until I had 'paced' off the last measurement.  I stamped in,<br/>
right under everyone's noses and nobody realized I wasn't really<br/>
sketching!  Number three in the series, eluded me.  A certain tree is<br/>
now a stump and I'm afraid the box might have been picked up with the<br/>
branches and limbs.  And someday I want someone to dissect a litterbug<br/>
to find what makes them do it.  It's an utterly gorgeous park, but the<br/>
amount of litter made me want to make someone walk the plank!  8/13<br/>
went back to "Your Ad Here"  I was perusing the shelves when a voice<br/>
behind me said "Now there's a suspicious looking pirate!" <br/>
Craftymouse, Dandelion and Tarheel were after the same box.  They gave<br/>
me clues to a few more Syracuse boxes, but I only had time to nail<br/>
"Cairn" before leaving the city.  Drove to Coxsackie (just South of<br/>
Albany) to meet with old friends and crash at their place.  I printed<br/>
out all the letterboxes in Greene county where they live, but didn't<br/>
bother to work them out on the map.  I made two mistakes.  1. They<br/>
live at the northern edge of Greene county, all the letterboxes were<br/>
down in the Catskills, another days travel. 2. The weekend I pick to<br/>
be there was a Noah's Ark, you gather the animals, I'll build the boat<br/>
rainstorm all weekend.  We stayed in and schmoozed with our hosts all<br/>
weekend.  8/17 we stopped again in Syracuse on our way home.  I got<br/>
"All Natural" and "Pirate Gear Required"  I was slightly miffed that I<br/>
was second finder on Pirate Gear by one day!  What would have been<br/>
more appropriate than a pirate being first finder on a pirate box? :D<br/>
  I spent the rest of the day in Clark Park hunting down "Cave<br/>
Paintings", both groups!  Five miles of hiking over rugged terrain!  A<br/>
certain letterboxer went after the series four days prior to me, and<br/>
if we meet at an event, I'm going to dress them down.  The Caves<br/>
series were very poorly re-hidden, two were out in plain sight and one<br/>
wasn't even recapped!  It hadn't rained, so there was no damage, but I<br/>
made sure that all 12 were re-hidden well.  I remembered the locations<br/>
for "It's Good for the Dog, Walk" and "Happy", and checked on those as<br/>
well.  Crafty mouse and Dandelion told me that a box had been added to<br/>
"That Darn Cat" series, so I went through it again.  I was surprized<br/>
to find that the boxes had been moved, so this was a little harder<br/>
than I anticipated.  Particularly, since I had already put in five<br/>
miles on Cave Paintings.  Couldn't find #4 in the series, however I<br/>
didn't have my compass and had to 'guestimate' the degree reading, so<br/>
it may be fine.  Found the other 5, plus the new box.  And how was<br/>
your week?<br/>

right after you and I kept hoping you had been first finder <br/>
on "Pirate Gear Required!" What would have been more appropriate?? I <br/>
STILL haven't found that one..even after catbead corrected my <br/>
bearings. I think the biggest problem was I went back at dusk and <br/>
realized I didn't have my flashlight with me. I did see 3 deer at the <br/>
crossroads just ahead of the box area and spent way too much time <br/>
watching them. By the time they moved on it had suddenly gotten very <br/>
dark. Oh well..just another reason to visit!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you liked the Wonders of Onondaga park. That was my first ever <br/>
series. Can't you tell by the LINED notebooks I used??!? Sheesh. The <br/>
Trio has been retired and a new box planted with new clues under <br/>
Furnace Brook Trail. The Corcoran students worked very hard on this <br/>
new nature trail and have made incredible progress. I still have the <br/>
Trio letterboxes so maybe they will get replanted somewhere else. I <br/>
will check on the third box of "I Never Strike Twice" just to make <br/>
sure it hasn't been trashed. Thanks for letting me know.<br/>
<br/>
I had a good weekend scouting spots. Also planted two new boxes...but <br/>
not too far away.These gas prices are really putting a damper on <br/>
letterboxing. grrrr... <br/>

<div>Wow Dagonell, you really cranked!! On Friday afternoon I went to ESF to look for Catbead's box and Lockwench's box that were both planted there. First I went for Catbead's... I looked and looked... I could not find it.  :o( I was so bummed! Since time was running short (I had somewhere to be at 6) I abandoned the search after 20 minutes and went for "All Natural" by Lockwench. I had actually given that up too... when all of a sudden wall-ah! Found it! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, one for one at least. It was fun! </div>
