clothing...figures the rain would hold out until mid afternoon today! <br/>
We got caught out in the middle of the Dora the Explorer boxes along <br/>
with Jiggs and the girls (who braved the storm for the last box when we <br/>
finally turned back). Conveniently, though, we remembered to bring our <br/>
umbrella and raincoat...and left them in the TRUCK!<br/>
<br/>
Still, a grand time was had by all! We even came up with a new postal <br/>
letterbox based on stories from this trip called "101 Things to Do (or <br/>
Not Do) at a Gathering. I'll start with our box: "Never stand in a <br/>
parking lot trying to stop your husband in the truck by flashing a <br/>
little leg while an elderly couple is coming the opposite direction!"<br/>
<br/>
See, now, aren't you sorry you missed it, Lightnin' Bug? :-)<br/>
