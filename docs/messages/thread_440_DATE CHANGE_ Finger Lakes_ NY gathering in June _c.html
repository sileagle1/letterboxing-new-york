&gt; The Finger Lakes gather scheduled for June 10th has been pushed <br/>
back one <br/>
&gt; week and will now be held on June 17th. I apologize for the switch, <br/>
&gt; especially if the new date won't work for people who had been <br/>
planning to <br/>
&gt; come. The park wouldn't take reservations for 2006 until this week <br/>
so there <br/>
&gt; was no way of knowing when the picnic pavilion we needed would be <br/>
free for <br/>
&gt; rental until now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've updated the event listing on Atlas Quest with information that <br/>
may be <br/>
&gt; useful for anyone who wasn't in attendance last year.<br/>

weekend, and I didn't want to have to choose again between my chimes <br/>
commitments (and my own 10th Reunion) and TONS O' LETTERBOXING FUN!<br/>
