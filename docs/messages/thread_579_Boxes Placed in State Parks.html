posting my findings regarding a previous topic here:  Do we ask<br/>
permission to plant in State Parks thereby subjecting our boxes to the<br/>
same free, one-year renewable permit system used for geocaches? Or do<br/>
we continue the somewhat traditional letterboxing habit of "Don't Ask,<br/>
Don't Tell and only deal with it if your box has been discovered by<br/>
staff. Letterboxing has been much more a secret society than<br/>
geocaching as we do not use sponsors or large sanctioned events. <br/>
<br/>
I didn't forget! Just want complete results.<br/>

PS Oh, and did anyone see that the Village of Inlet in the Adirondacks<br/>
is sponsoring a geocaching weekend...completely sponsored by the local<br/>
businesses?? EEk!</div>
