weekend. We hadn't planned on boxing (since it really was just a visit <br/>
to my friend and her family), but her daughter wanted to go, so we took <br/>
them for a little jaunt. They're near Allentown, so we picked up <br/>
Trexler's Tatanka and the first of the Ironton Rail series (too wiped <br/>
out to do more). They'll actually be heading to Knoebel's with us on <br/>
the 24th...anyone else going (besides Missmoon)?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, home again, home again...(sigh)...school in the morning!<br/>
