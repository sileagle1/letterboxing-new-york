<br/>
The two Jigglets and I want to take this opportunity to pass on our <br/>
thanks to Daina and Kevin in particular, and to all those who helped <br/>
organize, donate, cook, box, attend etc etc etc!<br/>
<br/>
It was an absolutely fabulous weekend, where, through the Sprite's <br/>
good graces, I was able to box my face off, along with Loch Wench, <br/>
Catbead and Dagonell, on Saturday, and then return Sunday with <br/>
Craftymouse and Dandelion to againbeat up the Park in Monroe County!<br/>
<br/>
We actually ran into local Rochester Boxers (Haiku Dada, Grasshopper <br/>
and Panda) on Sunday, and Ladybug (in Oswego) on Monday, that <br/>
weren't aware there was a gathering on Saturday in their own <br/>
backyard, no less! Anyhow, we met some more new faces, and were able <br/>
to do a little boxing on the side!<br/>
<br/>
By our count, we managed to find 59 of the 62 boxes planted in the <br/>
park - the only ones to elude us were Puzzled #2 (even went back Sun <br/>
Afternoon for another look), Monopoly #2 (there was a film crew <br/>
there ALL Day!) and Monopoly #3 (this one may have been dragged off <br/>
by a ferocious 4 (or perhaps 2)legged animal! We even managed to <br/>
pick up the Onions' Park in Monroe County series!<br/>
<br/>
Including the 10 boxes we picked up Friday, and the 3 we managed <br/>
today (yes there IS a Henry!!) we totalled 72 finds, 1 plant <br/>
(Erica's one-day 2 Hairs on the Head box), 1 HH, 27 exchanges 4 <br/>
attempts, and 3 pairs of tired feet! <br/>
<br/>
Now for the ALMOST part - our little Toyota's engine died about 1 <br/>
mile west of Kingston, ON on Hwy 401 (like I81 or 90). Through the <br/>
good graces os of some local folks, we managed to get the car to a <br/>
garage, and then these folks were kind enough to drive us to where <br/>
my wife was able to pick us up! <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the old girl is repairable...<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, we now sit at P33 F497 X122, tired , and (mostly) happy!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and we'll keep you posted!<br/>

<div>Wow, sounds like you had quite the adventure Jiggs! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It sounds like the gathering was a smash... I am so sorry to have missed it! Many thanks for everyone on their well-wishes to my girl and "Letterboxing Champion" Lucy who was in an accident the morning of the gathering (wasn't looking where she was going and ran full-speed into the bumper of a camper, flaying herself down the side). She had the drains removed from her back today, and the doctor says her wound looks good. Unfortunately a huge welt (where she hit the camper racing at 25 MPH) has sprung up, but it doesn't seem to hurt her at all (although it makes me wince every time I look at it). She is doing better and I really want to thank everyone on this list for their kind words and thoughts... you are the greatest!! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lucy is so special to me, and she really is the best Letterboxing companion. :o)  She doesn't have the stamina she used to, but she loves to hike and sniffs each box we find thoroughly! She then lays and waits patiently while I stamp logbooks (unlike my other greyhound Cliff who hates to pause on a walk). :o)  I can't wait until she is better so "Trailhoundz" will be a complete team once more! :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also a HUGE THANK YOU to Sprite, Highlander and everyone who is keeping the boxes in place for another few weeks!!! I will be going out to Rochester sometime next week (I hope!) to pound Duram-Eastman Park and stamp to my hearts content. :o) I am hoping to hit F100!</div>

<div>I :::thought::: that film crew was sitting right smack dab where the box should be. How dare they! Hummmm.....I couldn't find #3 either, but I saw what looked like a hole that had been dug out by a rotted stump when I was there.  Sorry to hear about the car troubles. That's a giant, expensive pain. </div>
