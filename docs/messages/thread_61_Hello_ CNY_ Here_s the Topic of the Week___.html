snowladies and hiding letterboxes inside their bodies someplace <br/>
where she's away for the holidays. <br/>
<br/>
Here in San Francisco, we've been enjoying sunny, warm days in the <br/>
60s -- but that's about to change to rain. I did breeze through <br/>
Central NY (Oriskany) for a quick, cold surprise holiday visit to my <br/>
family, and monitored 3 of my boxes there. Wow! The mini-boxes had <br/>
no empty pages left in their journals, so you've filled them with <br/>
stamps and my niece will put new blank pages in.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone's enjoying the holiday - here's to a new year filled <br/>
with fun letterboxing!<br/>

TOPIC OF THE WEEK <br/>
<br/>
Other than Rubbermaid, what other types of containers are used for <br/>
hiding letterboxes?<br/>

with the Gladware products - cheap and they have a<br/>

Lock. They pop up on sale at places like Wegmans and Quality Markets, <br/>

very sturdy, as far as we can tell. The best part is you can get them <br/>
on sale for like 2 for $3 bucks, usually.<br/>

was pleasantly surprised to find it and then to discover that the <br/>
price could be lower then most boxes. However, I wonder if the snap <br/>
mechanisms remain intact. I have experienced other snaps breaking off <br/>
in colder weather or just wearing out. In this case I was one of the <br/>
first visitors to this box so it was new. The weather was around 35. <br/>
After saying this I realize it is much colder in Western NY at this <br/>
time of the year. So, maybe WNY can be the testing grounds for this <br/>
type of box.  <br/>

My all time favorite container is the centrifuge tube.  They're small<br/>
(about the size of 2 film cannisters) yet hold a stamp of 1" x 1 3/4"<br/>
and a logbook 2 3/4" wide, cheap (2/29¢), survive temp. extremes of<br/>
-70ºF to +212ºF and are waterproof as long as the caps are screwed on,<br/>
extra easy to hide (therefore lowering the risk of accidental<br/>
discovery), small enough to tuck into a pocket when planting on the<br/>
trail, and best of all...they don't weigh down the backpack.  Can you<br/>
tell I'm in love?<br/>
<br/>
Happy 2005!<br/>
<br/>
catbead, on a mission to cover NY with centrifuge tubes.       <br/>
