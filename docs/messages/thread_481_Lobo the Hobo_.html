LBNA.  It's such a great idea, and I was all excited to go looking, <br/>
until I realized that there are two sets of clues posted, and both are <br/>
listed as found, which means it should move on and get a new location <br/>
with new clues.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know where this box is?  Did it get retired, or somehow <br/>
become a conventional hitch hiker?  It was listed as found a year ago, <br/>
and I haven't seen anything else come up about it since then.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know Lobo's whereabouts?<br/>
