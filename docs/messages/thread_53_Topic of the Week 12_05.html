success rate if we keep at this rate we could find 1000 boxes and <br/>
still feel like newbies.   <br/>
   I suppose it would help if we started our searches earlier in the <br/>
day and didn't have to stop because of darkness. Or maybe the 'we <br/>
still have xxx miles to cover we can't search too long' isn't <br/>
helping us much. But it's just so darn much fun to stop and check <br/>
out these places on the way. <br/>
