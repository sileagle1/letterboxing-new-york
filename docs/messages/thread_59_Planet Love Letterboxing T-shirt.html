The Highlander works at a company that shares space with a t-shirt <br/>
company called Planet Love Designs. They have a 50% Customer <br/>
appreciation day for the employees every year and this year, he got <br/>
me a shirt that I thought you'd all really like. Click on the link <br/>
below and scroll down to the pic of Hiker Mocha...looks just like a <br/>
letterboxer! It's a nice sturdy shirt that I won't be worried about <br/>
getting dirt on (since it's mocha) and they're extremely comfortable. <br/>
They're a very small and friendly company, so I'm sure they won't <br/>
mind this little plug...check them out!<br/>
