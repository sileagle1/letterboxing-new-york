<div>My letterboxing weekend started off a bit disappointing when I went to Commercial Art Supply on Saturday to pick up some carving material... and it was closed! Ack! Off to a BBQ in Liverpool, then I swung up to Michael's in Mattydale.  They didn't have any carving stuff either! Oh I was very disappointed! :o(  However, I did manage to do 3 of Catbead's letterboxes at Highland Forest Sunday. I was so excited that I overshot most of the clues but had a wonderful time! Now I just can't wait to get to Syracuse again this weekend... hopefully Commercial will be open so I can get some of my stamps finished and planted! </div>

<div>Thanks for the tips Catbead! I've bought Speedycut at Michael's on Erie Bld. before.  Last time they only had one block left and some nimwit had scribbled on it with a marker! :o(  So mostly I've gone to Commercial Art.</div>

<p>Awesome prices!! Holy cow!! I bought the Speedycut blocks and logbooks. Shipping was a bit high ($7 for 10-15 day shipping to Auburn) but I still saved about $15-$18 just on blocks and logbooks alone. </p>

<div>Yep, Commercial Art carries TONS of the white carving blocks.  The LBNA website doesn't recommend this kind, as they call it "crumbly", and although it is, it's never hampered my carving. :o) It's in the corner next to the books on the wall... there's a free-standing "island" which holds all the Linoleum Block cutting stuff as well as the stamp carving stuff. </div>

Off to a BBQ in Liverpool, then I swung up to Michael's in Mattydale.  They didn't have any carving stuff either! Oh I was very disappointed! :o(  However, I did manage to do 3 of Catbead's letterboxes at Highland Forest Sunday. I was so excited that I overshot most of the clues but had a wonderful time! Now I just can't wait to get to Syracuse again this weekend... hopefully Commercial will be open so I can get some of my stamps finished and planted! </div>
