<br/>
1. Plant near others.<br/>
I don't consider this a bad thing. It may be tacky to plant right on top of another box, or to <br/>
use another box as a waypoint, but having several boxes in the same park or area seems <br/>
to really draw the boxers. My most recently planted box, Many Happy Returns, has had as <br/>
many visitors as all my other boxes put together, as its along the Poet's Walk. I think the <br/>
possibility of finding multiple boxes is a plus to most folks. I call this the "Dartmoor <br/>
effect". <br/>
<br/>
2, Don't make it a mystery<br/>
I LOVE mystery boxes. I always seek them out. I think they are by far the most fun. I am in <br/>
the minority, I think. My Montana Memorial box is a 3 minute drive from the poets walk, <br/>
and has seen very little activity in the year its been planted. Its not even much of a <br/>
mystery!<br/>
<br/>
3. Don't rely on word of mouth<br/>
I like the secrecy of boxing, so don't attend gatherings. Consequently I haven't received <br/>
many WOM clues. I have distributed some to folks who have planted boxes I admire, or <br/>
who have written to complement my on my boxes. I planted a WOM box to try to limit <br/>
traffic to a sensitive area. Still, my WAS box* remains COMPLETELY unvisited after an entire <br/>
summer. <br/>
<br/>
Is it really a big deal for a box to  be popular? I'm not convinced. It doesn't really make the <br/>
hobby more fun. On the other hand its nice to know that you've planted something folks <br/>
are actually enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

*This box is presented as "word of mouth" due to the skill required to stamp in and <br/>
replace the box - There may be some waiting involved as the box location in is plain view. <br/>
Feel free to pass this on to any boxer you like, as long as you think they have the patience. <br/>

After parking at the Woodstock School of Art, you will find some trails behind the <br/>
buildings. This is their "sculpture garden". (maps containing a listing of the artwork along <br/>
the paths can be found in the gallery) Find the gazebo, which offers a handy place to <br/>
stamp in. From the "back" of the gazebo walk 15 steps to a pile of rocks. Your prize is in <br/>
here. You will understand the importance of carefully rehiding the box. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1727395935">Great topic, HeiHachi!  This is one of the provocative topics that will get you flamed on the big list, but fortunately cooler heads prevail here. <br/><br/>The biggest topic of debate is if one wants a popular box or not. Popularity for boxes is the same as popularity in high school. Some people like to have a LOT of friends, and some like to have just a few select ones.<br/><br/>I have a couple of boxing friends that BRAG that they have had no visitors or only ONE visitor to their box in the YEARS since they first planted it. When I was a new  planter, I didn't really understand this, but then I realized we are just different kinds of planters. You have to think of it in a marketing sense....who are you trying to attract to your boxes? One of my friends is trying to entice the "great puzzle solver" type of boxers....and for this reason he is really enjoying the groans from those who are struggling to solve his puzzle. On the other hand, there will be much gloating
 and celebrating when they DO solve it..and for him...this is where the enjoyment lies.<br/><br/>Another friend is trying to attract the "experienced hiker" type of boxers with his plants. He plants on long and arduous hikes...and loves hearing back from those who have taken on his challenge.<br/><br/>Then there is the camp I am in. I used to be a strictly "family" planter. I liked to plant boxes that took people to a place in their own area that they may not have known about, or taught them some local history. I made the clues easy and doable by even the youngest child..and I got a lot of grateful thank yous from families, as those were the kind I was trying to attract. I like how this hobby is one that brings all kind of generations together...grandparents with their grandkids, parents with their  pre-teens, etc.  But as I have been in letterboxing longer, I decided I also wanted to attract those adults with my same quirky sense of humor. <br/><br/>So although I
 continue to plant "location" or "history" boxes, I also now plant a series of pin-up girl images for my adult friends to enjoy. They are all WOM or are given as gifts to my friends. Someone who doesn't go to gathers might never find one, as they aren't published on AQ or LBNA. But that's ok. It's just another type of box...one that is available to those people who enjoy going to gathers.<br/><br/>So although your topic headings might be provocative ( plant near others, don't plant mystery boxes, don't attend gatherings, etc) you make a good point. If you (and I don't mean you personally; I mean the people who are reading this post)  are unhappy with the kind of visitors or amount of visitors to your box, you've probably done a lousy job choosing and/or targeting your market. Did you really think it out? Or did you just throw a box out there to have a plant? The bottom line is, you need to know who you want to attract to have a result that pleases you. . It's all in the
 target marketing. :)<br/><br/>One last note, don't be too sure that your less "popular" boxes haven't been visited. Make sure you go out to the boxes themselves and check the logbooks. I have found through experience that many ( NOT ALL!) of the people who like mystery boxes or long arduous hikes are also those who don't always log their finds. They like to participate but aren't really into counting finds online. So make sure you check those logbooks! <br/><br/>Just spreading a little bit of letterboxing love - <br/><br/>LW  PhD<br/><br/><b><i>bazzy3 &lt;mycoman@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1727395935replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1727395935ygrp-text"> <div>Just some random thoughts based on my own meager experience. . .<br/> <br/> 1.
