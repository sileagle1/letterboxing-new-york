thought I'd share!<br/>
<br/>
My partner at school was planning to box with me last week, but had<br/>
to work her other job last minute. Her daughter was bummed and I get<br/>
along pretty well with kids, so I carved up a stamp and offered to<br/>
take her.<br/>
<br/>
I'm tellin' ya right now, a kid on a boxing run is an absolute MUST,<br/>
espeically if you're digging around for Celtic Quinn and the Cosby<br/>
Kids' (including Moonlightgamer) boxes! LOL High schoolers and<br/>
college kids seem to believe there's absolutely nothing wrong with<br/>
sneaking around school grounds and in bushes behind people's houses<br/>
and such, but as a fully grown woman, I am not ABOUT to be arrested<br/>
for letterboxing! So, young Princess C, on her first boxing venture,<br/>
did quite a bit of box shagging while I sat in the car and waited to<br/>
drive off and leave her if the cops came (now, don't get mad...I'dve<br/>
told her mom where to post bail!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we first hit my Lock City box, only to find out that it had<br/>
been walled up behind about a foot of spray on concrete (anyone truly<br/>
determined to find this one should bring a jackhammer!). We also<br/>
checked on "If Only For A Moment" and this one is officially gone.<br/>
Not to be deterred in showing my young charge a good time, I took her<br/>
to Williamsville to hit PomPom and Celtic Quinn's Boxes by the Glen.<br/>
Pom Pom was easy, but the other two had so many folks out enjoying<br/>
the day that we had to abandon the search.<br/>
<br/>
From there, we went to the most distant and interesting place I could<br/>
think of to take a kid from Lockport...the Theater District. We did<br/>
pick up Knitica's new box and then, on a whim, dashed over on our way<br/>
to Kenmore to get my Weebls Footy Badger for Princess C. Finally, we<br/>
cruised back through Kenmore to get Jaguar Pride and one of The<br/>
Plumber's Tools series, all of which were still around and quite<br/>
safe. Celtic Quinn's Jaguar Pride seems to have been found by a<br/>
teacher at the middle school, though...they stamped in with a<br/>
generic "Excellent" teacher stamp and signed in saying "KMS STaff has<br/>
found you!" (oooo, somebody's BUS-TED!)<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great day! We found two hitchhikers to boot, so<br/>
Princess C's new total is about 7 boxes, I believe. She was<br/>
thoroughly delighted (and I have to say, even I felt like I had found<br/>
a great boxing pal next time the Highlander is busy), so if you see<br/>
her update on a box of yours, be sure to send this eager 9 year old a<br/>
thank you...it'll really make her day!<br/>
