hospital visits and cortisone shots, the Highlander was finally able <br/>
to struggle into work this week and see about the shirts. They should <br/>
be ready by tomorrow for us and we'll start mailing out the ones to <br/>
those of you who paid for it this weekend. I'm pretty sure we AREN'T <br/>
going to be doing any more travel or gatherings this year, so anyone <br/>
that wants to come to the hitchhiker hostel is welcome to grab your <br/>
shirt when you come. I just want to take care of the hubby for a <br/>
while and enjoy the recent peace that's come from finally getting him <br/>
some pain relief.<br/>
<br/>
Hope the world of boxing is still spinning without us! We did get to <br/>
take a trip to visit my grannies in Florida and took one letterboxing <br/>
to pick up A Leaf and Wanderings (planted by Kirbert). I also took a <br/>
trip alone to the the LBMA Gathering at Knoebels with my friend and <br/>
her family, but the Highlander and I shall never gather separately <br/>
(if that can be done) again if I can help it (after all, it's a two <br/>
person stamp!)<br/>
<br/>
I hear Team Dakota snuck back into town under cover of night and <br/>
might be staying...any word out there?<br/>

trails, adding to our F counts, but sometimes life gets in the way.  <br/>
Thank goodness for PLBs or I would be going through serious stamp <br/>
withdrawal!  (Pssst - hey buddy, got any ink?)<br/>

last visit &amp; would like to try to re-connect.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding tshirts:  since I do have a HH or two in my possession, <br/>
some Onions will roll into Medina this weekend.  I'll shoot for <br/>
Saturday.  We'll make alot of noise in your yard so this time you'll <br/>
know we're out there. ;)<br/>
