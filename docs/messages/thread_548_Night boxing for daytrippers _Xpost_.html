vistors, so those of you who can't come for the official gathering at <br/>
the pavillion on August 26th can still show up later that evening to <br/>
do some boxing (I've already changed the time for the gathering to <br/>
last until 11pm instead of 5pm).  The night boxes will ONLY be there <br/>
that night , though (since they can't be left in the spots we're <br/>
placing them longer than that), so you will definitely want to make <br/>
this trip!<br/>
<br/>
Also, we're thinking of taking Lock Wench's suggestion and making a <br/>
set of the day boxes into a psuedo-road rally (meaning you'll follow <br/>
a set of driving clues instead of walking ones). Darien Lakes doesn't <br/>
have quite as many trees and such for hiding boxes, so we've got to <br/>
take advantage of the surrounding area instead. It won't be as <br/>
intense as the Road Rally we went to in PA, but it'll be a chance for <br/>
those of you who've not boxed in Genesee, Orleans &amp; maybe even <br/>
Niagara County to pick up something old and something new in the way <br/>
of local boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the stamps will be placed in the current permanent boxes on <br/>
your route, while others will be placed as new permanent boxes. No <br/>
matter what, we intend to only have ONE logbook at the very end <br/>
rather than a full set of logbooks for each box (since that really <br/>
backfired at the last gathering...too many people all in one place!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this encourages more of you to stop in and say hi...hope <br/>
to see you soon!<br/>
