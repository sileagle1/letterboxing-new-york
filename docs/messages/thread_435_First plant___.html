Thanks Lockwench!!!!  I hope you don't mind, and I made sure to not<br/>
plant close to your boxes.  I just couldn't resist because it was such<br/>
a beautiful walk and it seemed fitting.  If anyone goes out a hunting<br/>
please let me know how I did with the clues.  I am so nervous that I<br/>
didn't make them clear enough, etc.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Woo hoo! New NY plants! I do not mind at all that you planted at <br/>
Woodchuck. It's a lovely place. Aren't those cedar groves gorgeous? I <br/>
have new snowshoes so I will have to go find these. Congrats on your <br/>
first plant!<br/>
