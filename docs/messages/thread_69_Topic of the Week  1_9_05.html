I carry a small plastic tote in the car and put in it what I need for the "find"<br/>
So, in my back pack is - a compass ( if I remember it), my log book, my stamp, colored markers,<br/>
directions, tissues, my daughters log book, her stamp, water, and probably other things I have most<br/>
surely forgotten and are probably in the car. <br/>

</span></blockquote>HA!  Me too, for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I carry the most basic of basics:<br/>
<br/>
* logbook<br/>
* my personal stamp<br/>
* my partner's personal stamp<br/>
* two ink pads (one blue, one green)<br/>
* compass<br/>
* waterproof see-through map case<br/>
* pencil<br/>
<br/>
And that's pretty much it.  We keep ours in the apartment and just<br/>
toss it in the car whenever we're hunting or traveling (we make a<br/>
point of trying to find at least one letterbox whenever we happen to<br/>
be out of town for any length of time).<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to start carrying more repair-oriented items like extra<br/>
logbooks, baggies, and so on.  Does anyone have any recommendations on<br/>
which repair items are essential for a good letterboxer's kit?<br/>
