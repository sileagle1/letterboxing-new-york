<br/>
I sent the message below to you privately but it came back with a <br/>
spam blocking message. Since I'm still curious, maybe some others <br/>
would be interested as well:<br/>
<br/>
Any plans on replacing Drillmaster? We have so few letterboxes in the <br/>
area and this was such a quality letterbox with great clues and an <br/>
awesome stamp! <br/>
<br/>
I wondered if the increased traffic to the monument aroused suspicion <br/>
and it was recovered by the caretakers. I can't imagine why this came <br/>
up missing otherwise! <br/>
<br/>
With High Hopes,<br/>

PS. I just noticed Trip Trap is also missing again! Oh Woe! It begs <br/>
for a replacement too, but maybe a more secure hiding spot...third <br/>
times a charm they say!!</div>
