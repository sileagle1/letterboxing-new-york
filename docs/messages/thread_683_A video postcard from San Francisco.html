<br/>
Here's a video clip on YouTube I want to share with you as if it were <br/>
a postcard.<br/>
<br/>
I choreographed a short dance piece based on square dance moves, but <br/>
without a caller  and without a square! Instead, the piece is danced <br/>
by 8 square dancers on beautiful mosaic stairs that overlook the <br/>
Pacific.  I combined square dance moves with pedestrian moves to fit <br/>
the mood &amp; theme of the piece. I believe that this was the 1st time <br/>
these square dance calls were ever danced on stairs!<br/>
<br/>
The music is by Terry Riley, and is titled, `G Song", as is this dance.<br/>
<br/>
Watch &amp; enjoy! And Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
