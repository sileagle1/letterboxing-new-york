Highlander) stamps for the gathering have already been planted and the<br/>
rest should go into local boxes either Sunday or Monday. PLEASE do not<br/>
go after any of these yet (with the exception of Woody, which I <br/>
planted<br/>
early on purpose). They will look like amusement park HHs in regular<br/>
boxes, but they won't have a logbook, so if you happen to see one in a<br/>
box you're doing in the next week or so, DO NOT TAKE IT! Stamp it into<br/>
your logbook if it makes you feel better, but I'll be putting out a<br/>
list of clues so you can drive around and snag them all by Thursday <br/>
and<br/>
I'll have clue books at the pavillion on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
I have at least one more request for those of you who are still on the<br/>
fence to join us. If you ARE coming, please make sure you actually go<br/>
to this website <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?</a><br/>
gEventId=171, click on Sign Up Now at the bottom of the RSVP list and<br/>
put in how many people are coming with you so we've got an accurate<br/>
head count. If you're going to stay overnight (and ONLY if you're<br/>
staying overnight) also sign up here as well and contact me with your<br/>
campsite # <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=102</a><br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you've never been to a gathering before, also check out <br/>
the<br/>
info at Atlas Quest on what to expect<br/>
