Who is going to start telling us their impressions of Desperately<br/>
Seeking Sun and -Suds?<br/>
<br/>
I've heard about the impression that Erica's sweetie's car made in the<br/>
ditch, and the impression that the tow truck driver made on her ("bra<br/>
burning?"  My goodness!  I haven't heard a reference to THAT in<br/>
decades!)  <br/>
<br/>
But what about the rest of you?<br/>
