<div>Well, we haven't been able to get out as much as many of you have, but we have some fun finds to report. I'm happy to report that two of my greyhound buddies, now "Budgie" and "Artichoke", :o) became curious about boxing, accompanied me on the Chauvet Cave series at Jamesville, and subsequently became HOOKED! Yeah, two new boxers in the area and both are already carving their first series to hide! :o)  We had a fun filled morning get-together as they carved their first signature stamps this weekend. Then --greyhounds and all!-- we went to Green Lakes and searched for/found Tom's Letterbox, Dalliance, and Noodle in a Basket. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am not sure if Artichoke and Budgie have signed up for this board yet, but watch out for them! They are TOTALLY hooked, LOL! Budgie has already bought out all the Mastercarve at the SU bookstore and she and Artichoke are brimming with ideas for series! Hee hee!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At any rate, in the past two weeks I have finished finding all the Lascaux cave series, did the Chauvet Cave series, and did the three boxes aforementioned at Green Lakes. I have to say... Dalliance was a blast, written in WW2 code! VERY interesting and so fun!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This weekend --weather depending-- Budgie, Artichoke, me, and our gaggle of 800 or so greyhounds are looking forward to letterboxing in the Syracuse and Oswego areas... make hay before the snow flies, eh? It will be very sad once winter comes and we cannot box anymore! :o(</div>

<div>Cool! Our greyhoud walking club is meeting at Rice Creek on Sunday, and then a few of us were going to box afterwards. Are "His Dark Materials" and the "Bird of a Different Color" still in place?  (I still have one to find in His Dark Materials, LOL!).</div>

<br/>
As far as pulling boxes for the winter.... I do it. I plan to pull <br/>
all of them. I don't want to go letterboxing in the snow! I'll be <br/>
honest, I've never been out boxing in the snow before, but I can't <br/>
imagine how one can find something out there, especially with the <br/>
incredible snowfall that we get around here. Not to mention with all <br/>
the Lake Effect snow that Oswego county gets, so many trees fall <br/>
down, signs disappear, trails change. All of your clues to a <br/>
letterbox could be completely incorrect after a harsh winter has <br/>
changed the landscape. I like to take my boxes in at the last <br/>
opportunity, work on them during the winter (I've recently started <br/>
making logbooks, so perhaps I'll replace older ones with newer ones) <br/>
and then replace them in the spring, checking my clues to make sure <br/>
they're still accurate. <br/>

I am heading down to the Mohawk Valley this weekend for my hiking <br/>
group (Mohawk Valley Alpiners) Annual Meeting, or I would join you in <br/>
Oswego. The Wizards of Oz have planted so many up there and I haven't <br/>
had a chance to get the rest of them. *sigh* You will love the boxes <br/>
there....such carving talent. :)<br/>
<br/>
With my box maintenance mostly done, I have switched gears to the <br/>
Desperately Seeking Sun event. I have all sorts of diabolical things <br/>
planned. Muah-ha-ha!<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned, as I should have a venue nailed down by the first of <br/>
December. In the meantime, anyone who would like to donate stuff for <br/>
our raffle (which will defray our venue renting costs) can contact me <br/>
offlist at <a href="mailto:lockwench@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lockwench@...</a>    I am looking for such things as <br/>
sheets of PZ Cut, logbooks, carving tools, lock n-lock, and the like. <br/>
I have already cleaned out my own letterboxing closet and have over <br/>
20 items for the raffle! We have 30 people signed up already so this <br/>
will definately be a fun filled event.<br/>
<br/>
More details to come...<br/>

<div>Thanks Craftymouse! :o)  Yes, barring a snowstorm, our greyhound walking club will be meeting at Rice Creek at 9:30 on Sunday and then Budgie, Artichoke, Spudhund and I (all letterboxers and greyhound fanatics, LOL!) --and any other letterboxers who show up ?:o) -- will stay afterwards to do the Rice Creek boxes. Hmm, I may add the Fort boxes to the agenda too! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hopefully tomorrow will clear up (I hear there is snow in Syracuse!!! My eyes are googling in horror, LOL!) and I can get some last-of-the-season letterboxing in at Clark Reservation. Since I need to go to Commercial Art SUpply anyway, I might as well, right...? ;o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks also for your pulling info.  So many of my boxes are microboxes (Biopsy containers) and I'm not sure how they will weather the winter, so you're right...I should pull them. After hunting season ends I'll have to go and pull my Historic Auburn series too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ya'll have a good weekend! :o)</div>
