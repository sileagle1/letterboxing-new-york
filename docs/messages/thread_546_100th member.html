prize, just bragging rights! I am even more pleased to see that <br/>
Fireball has been planting and bringing new people into the Buffalo <br/>
area and LBWNY and getting some more finders for those Buffalo boxes! <br/>
And more finders means more boxes and more boxes means more boxers and <br/>
more boxers means more gathers and...well you get the picture. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't been to a gather yet, you are really missing half the <br/>
fun of boxing. It's a great way to find boxers to box with, for <br/>
families with kids to find others, to put a face with a stamp and to <br/>
try some great food. And of course there are boxes to find! Be sure to <br/>
check out the August gather at Darien Lake State Park hosted by New <br/>
York's own Sprite and the Highlander. They are pros at gathers; having <br/>
hosted several, attended more, and have even written a list of tips <br/>
for attending a gather for the first time. You can find the tip list <br/>
on Atlasquest or Mark and Sue Pepe's blog. To read more about the <br/>
event and/or to sign up..check out www.atlasquest.com<br/>
