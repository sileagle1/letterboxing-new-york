spirit, and funny as all get-out.  And she's still talking to me <br/>
after I stood her up the other week.  <br/>
<br/>
My time at my NY summer job is running out, but I managed to get a <br/>
hefty batch of boxes planted while I was here.  I wonder if anyone is <br/>
willing to keep an eye on them for me?  If not, at least keep your <br/>
fingers crossed that they aren't all eaten by hungry racoons with a <br/>
taste for pink rubber!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't know me, I work at the Glimmerglass Opera <br/>
every summer, as the scenic artist.  My team and I paint the scenery <br/>
for the operas.  The rest of the year, I do just about the same thing <br/>
in Berkeley California, so Paul and I (who have not met, yet) <br/>
represent an odd Leatherstocking/SF Bay Area intersection.<br/>
<br/>
I've been hunting Paul's swimming hole all summer, and the hunt has <br/>
been a lot of fun.  With Lockwench's help, and the good-humor of <br/>
several of my opera cohorts, I've enjoyed a lot of great swimming <br/>
this summer in the West Canada Creek.<br/>

No injuries, here.  I think this may have come from a comment I made about the knitting I was working on,and that I was taking a wrist-and-fingers break, so *avoid* injuring myself.  I knit a few things for a knitwear designer last spring, and gave myself some kind of wrist injury.  That'll teach me to knit Muppet fur for ten hours without a break!<br/>
<br/>
Although, it isn't block printing, I have been printing acres of faux vintage wallpaper for work.  Which is a good lead-in to remind people to check out Block Printing Nirvana.<br/>

As far as I know, only Lockwench has visited this box, of which I am very proud!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails<br/>
