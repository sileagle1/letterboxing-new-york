over this Labor Day weekend. MtnMan and I will be leaving for <br/>
Assateague Is, MD tonight and have no one to watch over the letterbox <br/>
(there is some inconvenience involved with this placement). I tried to <br/>
attach it with a powerful magnet only to discover I was dealing with <br/>
aluminum housing apparently! Oh well! In the event you DO stop at the <br/>
coffee stop, sign the guestbook and put a star by your name! Email me <br/>
off list, I'll check the book for your name/trailname, then I'll snail <br/>
mail you an embossed edition!<br/>
<br/>
Now Wink, you are a different story! ; )) Let me know next time you are <br/>
up my way and you can stop by and stamp the extra one since you and <br/>
Tarheel have stopped at the Coffee Stop twice!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy to hear everyone had such a good time at the gathering! Bummed we <br/>
couldn't make it, : (  <br/>
<br/>
Have a fun and safe Labor Day weekend all!<br/>

I love Assateague.  I spent so many childhood vacations there.  And as <br/>
an adult, I was there with my sweetie when he saw his first bald eagle <br/>
in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time, and give those mosquitos a good fight!<br/>
