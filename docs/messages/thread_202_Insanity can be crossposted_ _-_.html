<br/>
With summer finally starting, I'm getting into party prep mode for<br/>
the gatherings (WNY in August ESPECIALLY)! However, unlike last year,<br/>
where we local folks really put out quite a spread for our visitors,<br/>
I haven't really heard from many of your about donating a box for the<br/>
theme. So, lemme see if I can rope some of you in and explain what<br/>
we're trying to do at the same time! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Basically, we want to encourage more folks to visit (more people<br/>
means more cool stamps and exchanges to see!), so we try to put out<br/>
as many boxes as possible and leave them out. I'm finding more people<br/>
from out of town are interested in tackling the Royalton Ravine<br/>
series than the nearby Medina boxes because they know they'll get a<br/>
bunch of boxes in a row without having to drive all over in<br/>
unfamiliar territory. Plus, at the gatherings, most of us just want<br/>
to hang out and box the immediate area, which makes a series in the<br/>
park even better.<br/>
<br/>
However, it's a lot of carving for one sprite and a guy with a sword,<br/>
so we need your help. We'd like at least 10 boxes that fit with the<br/>
recreational theme we've got and I think we've got a do-able series.<br/>
How about Monopoly? It's something simple we can all add to and if we<br/>
each tried to carve one space (Park Place, B &amp; O Railroad, etc.) we'd<br/>
definitely have enough to make a decent series that has yet to have<br/>
been done anywhere else. The Highlander and I have no problem hiding<br/>
the boxes and writing up the clues for the weekend, but we need more<br/>
hands to carve.<br/>
<br/>
(gets in front of the waving banner of LBNA and salutes the troops)<br/>
So now, men (and women and various and asundry boxing<br/>
pets/children)...NOW is the time for all of us to band together to<br/>
defend the honor of this great lan...er, REGION of ours! Will we let<br/>
the state of New York forever be called New York City by outsiders<br/>
that don't know any better...or will our boxes stand proud and true,<br/>
designating us forever as upstate New York, the land of the Finger<br/>
Lakes and the rushing Niagara waters (where the dairy farm smell is<br/>
plentiful, and crime is mostly limited to people snagging our boxes<br/>
and throwing them out)?<br/>
<br/>
WHO'S WITH ME?????!?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
(charges out along with a Speedball in one hand and a bag of Dollar<br/>
Tree erasers in the other)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, anyone that would like to add boxes to the Monopoly series<br/>
(or any other game/sport/playtime related boxes, contact us offlist.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
