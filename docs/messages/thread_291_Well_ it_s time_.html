only some discussion about a t-shirt design.<br/>

What you just witnessed was an example of inclusiveness instead of division. <br/>
If the countries on this earth did what we just did, then there would truly <br/>
be world peace.<br/>

&gt; yes, it's time for me to, again, give my two cents.  I am VERY sorry,<br/>
&gt; as this will offend many people.  You are all BS, and fighting over<br/>
&gt; silly $h!T.  THIS IS A GAME/HOBBY.  WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE<br/>
&gt; FUN!!!!!!!  People please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; Go out and find a box, and SHUT UP!!!  Real boxers don't care!!!<br/>
&gt; True boxers are out looking and NOT posting on these STUPID sites.<br/>
&gt; I'm sorry!!  I really am sorry, but the truth neeeds to be heard.  Get<br/>
&gt; lives, and get out and find a box!!!!!  Enough!!!!!!!!!!  Who really<br/>
&gt; cares!!!  As the shaved headed blonde woman (Susan Powers) says "STOP<br/>
&gt; THE INSANITY!!!"  If we were all out finding a box, we wouldn't have<br/>
&gt; this LOVE problem.  MAKE A LETTERBOX, NOT WAR!!!!!<br/>
