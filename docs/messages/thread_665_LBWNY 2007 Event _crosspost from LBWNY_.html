For anyone needing directions to the park, the address is 6121<br/>
Chestnut Ridge Road, Orchard Park, NY 14127 If you put that into Yahoo<br/>
Maps, Mapquest or Google Maps, that will let you do driving directions<br/>
from where you live to the park. Shirl, I put in directions from<br/>
Washington Hunt Elementary in Lockport to the park as an example:<br/>
<a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/flash/#mvt=m&amp;q2=6121+CHESTNUT+RIDGE+RD%2C+Orchard+Park%2C+NY%2C+14127&amp;gid1=11702787&amp;q1=50+Rogers+Avenue%2C+Lockport%2C+NY+14094&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=-78.673246&amp;lat=43.177376&amp;mag=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://maps.yahoo.com/flash/#mvt=m&amp;q2=6121+CHESTNUT+RIDGE+RD%2C+Orchard+Park%2C+NY%2C+14127&amp;gid1=11702787&amp;q1=50+Rogers+Avenue%2C+Lockport%2C+NY+14094&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=-78.673246⪫=43.177376&amp;mag=3</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, you can also use the map search on the event page to do<br/>
this and it will already have the park's address in for you! It's<br/>
right in the location box near the top of the page:<br/>

&gt; Daina, Do you know how long it takes to get from Lkpt to Orchard <br/>
&gt; Park?  Stephen and I want to come to the event, but my (would you <br/>
&gt; believe, I don't) 50th class reunion from Newfane is that weekend.  <br/>
&gt; Sat starts at 4 for gabfest, but It doesn't matter if I'm late.  I'm <br/>
&gt; on the comittee and they'll forgive me.  I told him if his Mom lets <br/>
&gt; him and It doesn't take to long to get there we could go for most of <br/>
&gt; the day.  He really wants to come and so do I.  I emailed Walter, but <br/>
&gt; I know his computer has been done, about signing Stephen and I up for <br/>
&gt; Newbie lbp.  Stephen wanted to sign up himself, but I told him to let <br/>
&gt; me read everything first.  He was going to sign up and use my <br/>
&gt; address.  I told him to wait until I looked into it further.  Hope to <br/>
&gt; see you in Aug.  Grandma 51<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [LbNY] LBWNY 2007 Event (crosspost from LBWNY)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a reminder to all you local folks, the Western New York <br/>
&gt; gathering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is coming up as the last holler of summer (and as representatives <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; said region, you are BOUND BY HONOR to attend, or at least send an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; envoy in your stead!) :-) We'll be in Orchard Park (Chestnut <br/>
&gt; Ridge, to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be exact) and our theme this year is "(LB)WNY is ON THE AIR!". We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intend to do a standard day tripper's Saturday event from 10-5, <br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also plan to have night boxing again and hopefully camping from <br/>
&gt; Friday<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; night to Sunday at one of the closer campgrounds.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We'd REALLY like to seed this park with boxes enough to make this <br/>
&gt; trip<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as worthwhile as our past gatherings have been (okay, and to try <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; meet or beat the Stone Mountain record!), so we'd love to get box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; donations. Any stamps you'd like to create that deal with music <br/>
&gt; of any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind are great, so long as we can get them by the beginning of <br/>
&gt; August<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (gives us enough time to plant them). Contact us offlist and we'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; give the address to send them to. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance and hope to see many more of you there!<br/>
