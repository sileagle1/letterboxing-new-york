                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-536635857">WOW! Last year at this time, boxes were few and far between... and <br/>
now, there's some darn good LB'ing to be had in CNY!<br/>
<br/>
Today, we nabbed Moss Island, which I enjoyed so much that I left a <br/>
new box just 1 or 2 feet directly above the Moss Island box, to <br/>
entice people to come or return to Moss Island. Two boxes so close to <br/>
each other -- who can resist. I'll post my directions later.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went on to Herkimer Home, followed by Skunk Bridge in <br/>
Herkimer, then finished with The Great Swimming Hole Caper at Trenton <br/>
Falls. Four boxes for 3 kids and 3 adults!<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, I planted one more box in Barneveld, so those <br/>
directions will be posted soon, too!<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful day! <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, I have the use of my niece's car to find the new boxes my <br/>
other niece and friend planted -- plus, plant one or two more &amp; <br/>
replace the missing Oriskany Namesake boxes!<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, I want to have printed copies of the clues for the <br/>
nearest boxes available, as well.<br/>

and might have scooped up your box....<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean that you *intend* to have printed directions to your own<br/>
new boxes, or hope that we'll bring along printed directions to the<br/>
new boxes that others have planted recently?  <br/>

They seem to have multiplied like rabbits in the past week. That way, <br/>
folks can grab some finds while they're here. There are my 3 in-town <br/>
boxes, and the new 'Fifteen Years' box - 3 miles away. Plus, my niece <br/>
and her friends now have about 5 boxes (3 are brand new) within a 3 <br/>
mile radius.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. LOVE your crow stamp!<br/>
