<div>How about some dots after the words on the front, like.......   as in continued on the back. If it's just the words, the font should be eye-catching, not cutesy, but eye catching/classy. Just the words would be cheaper also. Maybe have the dots a different color than the font. <br/></div>

Let me know if there is an item you'd like that I didn't include.  No<br/>
problem as long as Cafe Press has it.  I think LockWench may have<br/>
created a monster.  I can't wait to make up more stuff.... <br/>

feedback.  I can't wait to make up more stuff....  Nor</div>
