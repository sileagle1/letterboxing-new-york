                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-335579943">Whew! I posted new letterboxes in the Syracuse Inner Harbor area. One <br/>
is called "Give Life" and the other is a series of boxes called "I <br/>
Found My Inner Child at Inner Harbor". I hope some of you will take the <br/>
time to seek these out. I try to hide boxes in some of my favorite <br/>
areas and to hopefully introduce people to areas they might not have <br/>
visited before.<br/>
<br/>
Is this criteria for most placers? Or do you have other criteria?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, off to FIND some boxes this weekend and to plant a few down in the <br/>
Mohawk Valley area. When I get back I will be ready to plant the last <br/>
couple of series I have been working on and then I will take a well <br/>
needed break to just enjoy hunting other people's boxes. Happy Hunting, <br/>
everyone!<br/>
