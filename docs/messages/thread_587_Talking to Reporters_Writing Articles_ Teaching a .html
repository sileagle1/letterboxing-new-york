                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-761366601">Oh what a tangled web. I am growing weary over the publicity issue.<br/>
Why does every boxer think this was going to be a secret forever and<br/>
ever?? And alongside an even more popular hobby called geocaching???<br/>
If you want to be pissed at publicity, then write to the Smithsonian<br/>
and chastise them for bringing it to the USA.  Why not write hate mail<br/>
to Tom Cooch and Rae Record and Randy Hall, etc and complain that they<br/>
have ruined the hobby by sharing it and writing a how-to book? SEE HOW<br/>
RIDICULOUS THIS SOUNDS??   Recent articles in GAMES magazine, Family<br/>
Fun and other publications have opened this hobby to the masses. Choi,<br/>
 LBNA's webmaster, just did a television interview on Chronicle in New<br/>
England. Well, God bless as I never would have found this hobby<br/>
without Smithsonian Magazine. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, people are understandably upset that boxes might come<br/>
up missing when overly enthusiastic newbies charge into the woods and<br/>
streets to find boxes. Well well..I was one of those overly<br/>
enthusiastic newbies as well. And I didn't screw up a single box. <br/>
<br/>
Look, people. I have lost many boxes in the past.MANY.  It's sad and<br/>
upsetting but then I had to become more ZEN about my boxes and do what<br/>
I could to protect them. I try to tell myself that they are temporary<br/>
art anyway, not under lock and key and alarm systems in some museum.<br/>
It's still upsetting to see all that hard work be lost so I have also<br/>
learned to camoflage them better, put F restrictions on boxes that<br/>
might require more stealth or are in sensitive areas, make some<br/>
special boxes WOM  and spread EDUCATION wherever and however I can.<br/>
Yes, I was hired to teach a class (as a fundraiser)  and I do even<br/>
more for nothing...donating my time and even materials. Yes, I've<br/>
spoken to students at Syracuse University and hikers in the<br/>
Adrirondacks. I've only shown my OWN boxes and my OWN clues. I teach<br/>
people how to do the proper research to find other boxes after they've<br/>
tested the waters and decided if it's something they want to stay<br/>
with. THE CAT HAS LONG BEEN OUT OF THE BAG AND THE SHIP HAS SAILED. So<br/>
let's do what we can to protect our boxes and make sure people learn<br/>
the same way WE DID. Through patient instruction, kind encouragement<br/>
and a loving and open manner.<br/>
<br/>
Let the stoning commence.<br/>

<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">I think it is no secret that I am not a fan

learned from a friend, etc.  I felt honored that they wanted to share with 
me the secrets that were lying out there, waiting to be found.  They took 
me out, searched for boxes with me and showed me how to stamp my thumbprint in - 
I didn't even have a stamp yet!  Once I was hooked, they showed me how to

everything.  If I had not been told of this hobby, my life would have still 
gone on as usual.  I would have been out hiking with my dogs and friends 
anyways.  I would have gotten to know a few less people, seen a few less 
different places, but, oh well.  I am sure there are a lot more

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-886859833">Yes, no stoning here! I got into many heated discussions when I visited CT this past weeknd and it was very interesting seeing how points of view differ from state to state. NY is still in it's relative infancy so we are unaffected by some of what goes on in the more letterbox-populated states. <br/><br/>I do not seek out publicity. I do not contact newspapers or  magazine writers or reporters or offer up classes to groups. . But if I am contacted by an individual or group, or if I know an article is being written and the reporter is going into with NO input from anyone in the letterboxing community, you can bet your bottom dollar that I am going to contact them.  I try to make sure an article has a fighting chance of being semi-accurate. As I said before, anyone holding on to the dream of this hobby going back to the old days is deceiving themselves.<br/><br/>Our Catbead is often contacted by the local media as she has a personal website that is sub-labeled as Boxing
 in Syracuse, and her link is posted on many lists and websites.  Any reasonable internet search will bring up her contact information. However, she chooses not to speak to the press and I respect that. While she would be a perfect candidate, as she has a long history of local boxing and has an excellent educational style, I can understand why she shys away from speaking up. No worries. I did contact that reporter she listed, as many of you expected I would. I explained to the reporter how many in the letterboxing community would prefer a more "friend -to -friend" organic growth to the hobby and he said he had heard much of that angle from the "finders" he had spoken to.  I was pleased when he told me that he was going letterboxing with some letterboxing friends so that he could learn first-hand about this hobby before he wrote anything.  That is doing more than most writers do, and l commend him for that. <br/><br/>I learned of this hobby from my mother, who
 sent me the original Smithsonian article, which I still have. I was a late starter but I have always been grateful that she shared this info with me.  I finally  found a hobby which combines all my loves.<br/><br/>LW<br/><b><i>Tracy Baxter Haynes &lt;tbhaynes@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-886859833replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-886859833ygrp-text"> <div> </div><div><font face="Palatino Linotype">Ooo, I hope there will be *no* stoning  :-)  After all, this is our little friendly state board, not the *big*  list.  LOL  </font></div> <div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div> <div><font face="Palatino Linotype">I think it is no secret that I am not a fan  of the mass, overt publicity of our hobby.  I like the idea of a more  gradual, organic growth of letterboxing.  This is a *special* hobby, it is  unique.  I like the idea of its existence being passed around from one  trusted friend to another.  I learned of this hobby from a friend, who  learned from a friend, etc.  I felt honored that they wanted to share with  me the secrets that were lying out there, waiting to be found.  They took  me out, searched for boxes with me and showed me how to stamp my thumbprint in -  I didn't even have a stamp yet!  Once I was hooked, they showed me how to  obtain supplies, design and carve a signature stamp.  </font></div> <div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div> <div><font face="Palatino Linotype">There are some who will say that they never  would have found this hobby if it wasn't for some type of mass publicity,

 to students at Syracuse University and hikers in    the<br/>Adrirondacks. I've only shown my OWN boxes and my OWN clues. I    teach<br/>people how to do the proper research to find other boxes after    they've<br/>tested the waters and decided if it's something they want to    stay<br/>with. THE CAT HAS LONG BEEN OUT OF THE BAG AND THE SHIP HAS SAILED.    So<br/>let's do what we can to protect our boxes and make sure people    learn<br/>the same way WE DID. Through patient instruction, kind    encouragement<br/>and a loving and open manner.<br/><br/>Let the stoning    commence.<br/><br/>The<br/><br/>LW *can you tell I'm testy    today?*<br/><br/></div></div></blockquote> <div></div> </div> </blockquote><br/><p>

I couldn't AGREE with you more, LW, the word is out.  Talk or don't<br/>
talk, its a personal choice...freedom of speech, right.<br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of ways to not publicize your boxes, lots of smaller<br/>
boards, WOM, whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
I like what you said about ZEN, letterboxes are like sandcastles,<br/>
pumpkin carvings, sidewalk chalk drawings....they probably won't last<br/>
forever.  Look at hitchhikers...you let them go, you might never see<br/>
them again.<br/>
<br/>
As for reporters, people want to read about interesting things. <br/>
Letterboxing is interesting.  Educating them is important, because<br/>
they have the power to educate others.<br/>
<br/>
I like to make some of my boxes open to everyone.  I like to keep some<br/>
of my boxes available to only a few, because I think they are special.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it comes down to "control".  I don't think we can "control"<br/>
letterboxing...how it grows, who participates, etc.  How do you<br/>
control the wind?  Its always changing, always fluid.  When you place<br/>
a box, its out of your control, and in the control of nature and the<br/>
finders.  I bet if we found a way to track how boxes went missing, I'm<br/>
sure we would find just as many hunters, punk kids, squirrels, etc.<br/>
that destroy, steal, expose, boxes as NEWBIES.<br/>
<br/>

I *do* hate hearing about all the publicity LB'ing gets in every-other-magazine nowadays, I *do* cringe when I see huge groups of people --kids or adults-- sprawled all over the trail with the box strewn here and there (as I came across in Jamesville last fall with some 20+ Brownie/Girl Scout troop clomping through the sensitive underbrush after a box -- so nice.

Crucify me for it. I can't help it... I love doing artwork, I love carving, and when a box goes missing it means it became litter which is totally against the environmentalist in me.  I can't get "zen" about my art becoming litter no matter how hard I try.  :o(<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't make me -or anyone else who believes in the more traditional aspects of LB'ing-- anti-newbie, anti-education, anti-Girl Scouts, anti- magazines, or anti- anything else.   I suppose it makes us traditionalists (and I'm not surprised I fall to that side of the fence, because I still contentedly listen to my records/LP's and cassettes, while most of the world bounds away on IPods, M3P's, DVD's and other newfangled gadgets).  :o)<br/>
<br/>
The Cat may be out of the Bag with all this raring publicity --and it IS-- but personally I think it would be best to put up some sort of fence around the yard so the cat doesn't run out into the highway and get hit by a truck.  IMHO, anyway.  <br/>

I suppose it makes us traditionalists (and I'm not surprised I fall to that side of the fence, because I still contentedly listen to my records/LP's and cassettes, while most of the world bounds away on IPods, M3P's, DVD's and other newfangled gadgets). :o)<br/><br/>The Cat may be out of the Bag with all this raring publicity --and it IS-- but personally I think it would be best to put up some sort of
 fence around the yard so the cat doesn't run out into the highway and get hit by a truck. IMHO, anyway. <br/><br/>~Trailhoundz<br/>*TGIF!*<br/><br/>Jen <br/>with ex-racing greyhounds extraordinaire. .. <br/>Lucy (Pw's DixiesQuick) <br/>&amp; Clifford (Halftime Kid)<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; -&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;- &gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; -&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;- &gt;-&gt;<br/>Our website: <a href="http://www.jenzstudio.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.jenzstud io.com</a><br/>Our NEW Greyhound Blog!: <a href="http://trailhoundz.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trailhoundz. blogspot. com</a><br/><br/>____________ _________ _________ _________ _<br/>PeoplePC Online<br/>A better way to Internet<br/><a href="http://www.peoplepc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.peoplepc .com</a><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/> <div> </div><hr size="1"/> Talk is cheap.
