Wonders today. We did skip the Overlook drive-by as the Overlook was  <br/>
majorly crowded, but the trail boxes were well worth the return trip.  <br/>
As a bonus, we ran into Team Safari out on the trail. We boxed  <br/>
together for a while, then they had to head home while we grabbed the  <br/>
last few boxes. A few muggles along the way, but the boxes from #11  <br/>
on all seemed safe and sound as of this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Out on the autumn trail, letterboxing with my daughter..... what  <br/>
better way to spend what may be the last warmish day we get for quite  <br/>
a while? :-)<br/>
