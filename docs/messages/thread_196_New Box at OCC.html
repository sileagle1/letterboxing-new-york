bring your letterboxing gear as I planted a simple box there this week. <br/>
So if the kids get antsy and you need to stretch your legs...check it <br/>
out. It's called Tomorrow's Heroes.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are Atlasquest premium members..there is a a premium box <br/>
close by. Less than 5 miles away are a dozen or so of my other boxes, <br/>
so you could make a JazzFest/Letterboxing weekend!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is graduating that weekend so I'll probably just make the <br/>
Jazz Fest on Sunday. Hope to see you there.<br/>
