wear them. Why?  "Because people in this village would think I look strange <br/>
in a hat", she says.<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in Boston, there were certain fashion taboos around wearing <br/>
anything even remotely resembling a fetish item: vinyl, motorcycle jackets, <br/>
or leather pants for example.<br/>
<br/>
Here in SF, I've seen an occasional person nearly or completely naked and <br/>
standing at a major intersection. People look, but don't make much about it. <br/>
We have HUGE annual fetish street fair with people wearing and doing things <br/>
that would get them thrown in jail anywhere else. It's about 8 blocks long, <br/>
and is one of the 2 biggest income generating events for this city.<br/>
<br/>
When you first move here, you have to get used to how accepting of diverse <br/>
lifestyles and how politically correct this city is. Our fumbling president <br/>
would never dare to set foot here -- he knows better! He'd freak out!<br/>
<br/>
But try to get a slice of pizza that's as good as New York's -- impossible! <br/>
And they call it New York Style Pizza!<br/>
<br/>
Our art museums don't compare to the East Coast's because this state was <br/>
pioneer territory until after 1900, and by the time people collected art, <br/>
the good pieces were snatched up or very expensive.<br/>
