<br/>
The Elba Onions went out this past Saturday, attempted 8 and found <br/>
all 8!  Hooray!  We successfully found Tripoli, Ontario County Park, <br/>
3 different fingers of the Finger Lakes Mystery, Sugar Hill, <br/>
Blueberry Patch, and Mystery at the Glen.  We had a great, though <br/>
exhausting time, and a day filled with different "animal" adventures:<br/>
<br/>
"Tripoli" had been "marked" by a tom cat.  Stinky, stinky box but the <br/>
contents were fine (You open it - I don't want to touch it...No, you <br/>
open it!).<br/>
<br/>
"Sugar Hill" was being gaurded by a sleepy looking, out-in-the-<br/>
daytime raccoon, which fortunately kept his distance (Get the pepper <br/>
spray out just in case.  Pepper spray?  I thought *you* brought the <br/>
pepper spray.  Kids, get back in the van).<br/>
<br/>
And one of the fingers had been opened by a multi-toothed animal who <br/>
fortunately only likes to chew on plastic bags and tupperware and <br/>
left the good stuff alone.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked on a couple of our Thruway boxes - the NYS Insect and <br/>
the NYS Beverage - and were happy to find people had stamped in and <br/>
properly replaced them several times.<br/>
<br/>
Now off to place more!<br/>

&gt; Hi New Yorkers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Elba Onions went out this past Saturday, attempted 8 and found<br/>
&gt; all 8!  Hooray!  We successfully found Tripoli, Ontario County Park,<br/>
&gt; 3 different fingers of the Finger Lakes Mystery, Sugar Hill,<br/>
&gt; Blueberry Patch, and Mystery at the Glen.  We had a great, though<br/>
&gt; exhausting time, and a day filled with different "animal" adventures:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Tripoli" had been "marked" by a tom cat.  Stinky, stinky box but the<br/>
&gt; contents were fine (You open it - I don't want to touch it...No, you<br/>
&gt; open it!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Sugar Hill" was being gaurded by a sleepy looking, out-in-the-<br/>
