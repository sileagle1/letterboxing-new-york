will allow letterboxers to bring their dogs. Besides allowing leashed<br/>
dogs on the trails, they will allow dogs to be in the lodge with us as<br/>
we gather for the Desperately Seeking Sun event!<br/>
<br/>
Obviously dog owners will be responsible for their pets and should be<br/>
aware that we expect about 100 people at this event, many of them<br/>
children. If you think your pet might be skittish with so much<br/>
activity, please rethink bringing him/her. But if you have a dog who<br/>
does well in crowds and around other dogs, please feel free to bring<br/>
your pet!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to encourage boxers who haven't attended in the past<br/>
because they did not want to leave their dogs at home.<br/>
