How do you not look so obvious letterboxing while you're looking for <br/>
the box?<br/>
<br/>
We think we're doing pretty well while we stamp in, find and return <br/>
the box but I feel like we're sticking out like a sore thumb walking <br/>
around with a piece of paper in one hand and usually a compass in <br/>
the other following the clues. Once at the location we look around <br/>
scope out the situation and go from there on actually retrieving the <br/>
box. It's the from the car to the location thing I'm wondering about.<br/>

I put my clue sheet on a clipboard and carry a pen and a camera. That
way, I hope, it appears that I'm working on some project that involves
the use of a compass. I suppose if anyone asks, you could tell them
you're lost and trying to get your bearings.<br/>
