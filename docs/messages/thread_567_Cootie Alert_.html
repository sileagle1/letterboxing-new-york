you), has packed many many of his minions for this weekend's WNY <br/>
gathering at Darien Lake State Park. If you are attending either the <br/>
day event and/or the sleepover event (with cool nighttime boxing!) <br/>
be very very careful with your bags, backpacks and/or open jacket <br/>
pockets. I can speak from experience when I say.....CQ and his <br/>
siblings are relentless and utterly stealth when planting these <br/>
things. No one is safe!<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I even returned from the Kingston, Ontario gathering (a <br/>
gathering where no Quinn was present) and unpacked my suitcase only <br/>
to find a grinning cootie made by Celtic Quinn under my underwear! <br/>
Don't even ask me how it got there! I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. Just <br/>
remember, you have been warned!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously folks...if you haven't been to a gather yet, this is <br/>
definately the gather for you. The hosts have planned gathers <br/>
before, and they are always fun and welcoming. A perfect place for <br/>
newbies as this gather is always well attended but not so <br/>
overwhelmingly huge to make you feel lost. They always come up with <br/>
clever new games and boxes but the real joy is the spirit of <br/>
friendship exhibited by Sprite, the Highlander, and the Quinn <br/>
Clan..as well as the rest of the growing WNY boxing group. <br/>

On LBWNY this weekend: Boy, with an intro like that, we've got some <br/>
major stuff to live up to...now we really GOTTA be nice to everyone! <br/>
(throws out the "WNY Should I Respect YOU???" afterparty agenda with <br/>
a sigh)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I know many of you are already joining us, but we'd love <br/>
to have even last minute additions. Don't forget to sign up if you <br/>
can so we'll have enough clue booklets and hot dogs to go around!<br/>
