 cross the bridge.  The park on this side is very nice, as is the aquarium, but otherwise there isn't much here.  I'm not sure what US sights you can access from the Canadian side, but some other really cool things to do here are the Maid of the Mist, a boat ride that takes you right next to the falls.  A beautiful ride.  Also, the tour underneath the falls where you can experience the actual power of the falls because you're in a cave like place underneath it.  You can still do these things by staying in Canada and crossing the bridge.  If you're close enough, you can walk across the bridge.  Go online and get as many coupons as you can for the previously mentioned adventures.  I haven't been up there to get boxes yet, but some were just replanted on this side down in the gorge.  Commonly known as Devil's Hole.  I am going to NF, NY tomorrow to pick someone up to come and work on my computer, but I spend as little time
 there as possible.  Hope this helps some.  I know it sounds awful knocking our own side like this, but it's all true.  When the city gets money from the government for renewal, it never happens.  Grandma51 aka Shirley<br/><br/><b><i>gerania93 &lt;gerania93@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-165008706replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-165008706ygrp-text"> <div>I'm from NJ, LBMA for anyone who doesn't know me.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-723460395">Thank you, thank you. I did a bit more digging (not that I doubted<br/>
you) and found that there isn't really a NF NY at night, at least not<br/>
for a middle aged woman and a teenager. I read one disturbing account<br/>
about a couple who stayed the night with a child during a college<br/>
interview trip. The family chose a nice hotel, but felt very uneasy<br/>
about the neighborhood, thought that it looked rather shabby. Upon<br/>
return to the hotel after a day out, the teenager pointed out the<br/>
activity at a couple of houses and said, "Look Mom, Dad, those are<br/>
'crack' houses"! Geez. I booked 3 nights in Ontario and hope to spend<br/>
an afternoon on the NY side. It's a shame, it could be so much more.<br/>
Thanks for the heads up on the boxes.<br/>

to and from ON. My son wanted to back to Goat Island. The two of us<br/>
did as much as any two humans could have possibly done in a few days<br/>
and had a fantastic time! The Niagara Falls and river, as they should<br/>
be, were definitely the highlight of the trip. In this order we did:<br/>
Cave of the Winds, Maid of the Mist, Whirlpool Jetboat. The best part<br/>
about the Jetboat trip was the fact that aging Mom had signed up for<br/>
and participated in such an adventure. I was held in high esteem for<br/>
an entire hour.<br/>
