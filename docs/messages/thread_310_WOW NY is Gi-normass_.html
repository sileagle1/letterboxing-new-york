the gather!!! Technically we never made it to the west. Though, I<br/>
heard mention of waterfalls and buffalo that tempted me to go.  (This <br/>
trip made me believe that there is hair growing on the top of my feet <br/>
and the notion of eating "elevensies" at one point sounded like a<br/>
great idea!) Actually dinner out was elevensies!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all the carvers out there for making this so much fun. <br/>
Thank you Sprite and Highlander for all the "work" put into this.  We <br/>
had time for a lot of everything!!!  We even left a new HH which was <br/>
discovered later to have been found :) Also, thanks, to all, for the <br/>
donations for the raffles.<br/>
