<div>Hi CPAScott,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had a full letterbox weekend too! Saturday me, Spudhund, and our canine contingent went up to Canastota to find the 4 letterboxes in that area. It was great... we learned a bit of history, I got a trip down memory lane (used to live in 'Stota) and found some awesome boxes (if you go up that way, DON"T FORGET your camera, especially for the Fenner Wind Farm Box! If you do you'll regret it! Breathtaking!!). :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sunday I took the pups to look for Trio of Visually Impaired Rodents at the Nimo Power Plant in Syracuse. I had read in the clues that it was a popular party place for teenagers, but being the *TOTAL NERD* I am, I never went to parties in high school or college, and wasn't quite sure what I'd find! TONS of broken bottles and glass! Nasty partiers, LOL.  I was able to get the dogs through uscathed but if you letterbox with your dogs, be sure to have them wear booties for this series of boxes! :o)  This was our first series we found totally by ourselves, just me and the dogs.  All my previous 10 boxes I've searched for with Spudhund. What a blast! Great boxes! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This Sunday the puppers and I are going to head down to search at Highland Forest. Looks like I'll need to get a compass for these boxes though. And figure out how to use it, LOL.  I was so proud, and I only got lost once (man I need to figure out Left from Right...) ;oD</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Man, letterboxing is so addicting!!!!! :o)</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Jen :  The Pookah Clan was at Clark 
Reservation on Sunday (going after Catbead's 2nd cave series) and came across a 
nice couple that had three greyhounds.  We "hinted" around thinking that 
maybe they were you, Spudhund and "the kids" but they never took our hints so we 
moved on.  Now I see that on Sunday you were in the city so, that definatly 
was not your search party we ran into at Clark Reservation.</font></div>

<div><tt>I think it was last year we noticed the parks were collecting
well beyond the "summer" season.  A couple of years ago
we began buying the NYS Empire Pass and found it easier on the pocket
book.  For us the thing pays for itself in a few weeks, and after
that I have that satisfying feeling each time we pull up to the booth
that we're getting in for free, we don't even have to remember to
bring any money.....so if you ever see me pulling into a State Park
with a big grin you'll know why.
