<br/>
I don't know about the other organizers, but I didn't say anything to the boxers featured in <br/>
the article about the consequences -- mostly because I'm sure they didn't mean to cause <br/>
trouble, as well as the fact that there isn't going to be another article in our area immediately <br/>
(or a gathering, for that matter).  We are still in "negotiations" with the park over how many <br/>
boxes we will be able to leave as permanent plants.  Certainly, if they are going to charge us <br/>
the (geocaching) fee of $25/box, it will be few if any, squashing our hopes of making this <br/>
park a letterboxing destination.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I personally shy away from personal publicity, but was disappointed to see newbies <br/>
featured in this article instead of some of my Wonders cohorts, who have more breadth of <br/>
experience and history than these boxers who started in May or June.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what do you think about a television story on letterboxing?  (Ducking from the can of <br/>
worms this may open.)  Same concerns, just a larger scale?<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see so many friends -- old and new -- this weekend! Thanks for making it so <br/>
much fun.<br/>

How would they know it caused a problem if no one told them? They'll just<br/>
skip blithly on thinking it was a grand idea. <br/>
