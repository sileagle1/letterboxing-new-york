<br/>
I take my daughter to the Saturday morning kid's craft class at our <br/>
local Michaels on a weekly basis.  I got to be good friends with the <br/>
instructor, and while waiting for my daughter to finish up one <br/>
morning, I was looking around the room at the displays for upcoming <br/>
classes.  I noticed a display on a stamp-carving class coming up.  <br/>
The instructor (Carol) saw my interest and was talking to me about <br/>
stamp-carving.  She mentioned that she uses her stamps that she <br/>
carves for letterboxing.  So of course being nosy, I asked her what <br/>
letterboxing was.  She filled me in on all the details.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home, I looked up the website she wrote down for me.  <br/>
Once I started reading, I was intrigued.  I signed up for the class, <br/>
and found my first letterbox on the way home with my brand new <br/>
stamp, logbook, and inkpad in hand.<br/>
<br/>
This was two years ago.  We've been boxing ever since.  And it's <br/>
been a life saver at times.  I was diagnosed with lupus in February, <br/>
and have had to give up a lot of my activities due to the fatigue <br/>
and pain that comes and goes with the disease.  But the one thing <br/>
that has stayed the same with no change is my letterboxing.  In fact <br/>
my doctor encourages me to continue as it's good for me to get out <br/>
in the fresh air and hike.  So letterboxing is not only a hobby, but <br/>
therapy as well!!!<br/>
<br/>
Didn't mean for this to turn into a testimonial ... I'll get down <br/>
off my soapbox now.  :D<br/>
<br/>
Wishing everyone a happy, healthy, and festive Turkey Day.  <br/>
Hopefully this weather will break so we can all get out and do some <br/>
boxing!!!  But then again, this IS Upstate NY  &lt;snicker&gt;<br/>
