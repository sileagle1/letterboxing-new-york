something to do that everyone from the grandkids to Old Uncle Ernie<br/>
can enjoy? Why not give them all a store bought stamp and a notepad<br/>
and bring them to our mini gathering?<br/>
<br/>
We finally have a date, time and meeting place! On Friday (the day<br/>
after Thanksgiving) at 10 am, the Oneida Community Mansion House in<br/>
Oneida NY has graciously offered LBNY the use of their lovely "lobby"<br/>
room for this event. If you have never been to this wonderful National<br/>
Historic Landmark, you are really in for a treat. You can read more<br/>
about the mansion in the Taphophiles, Unite! - Oneida Community<br/>
Mansion House letterbox clues.<br/>
<br/>
The Mansion House is not charging us for the use of their room for our<br/>
"exchange" gathering, which is incredible generous as they usually<br/>
charge several hundred dollars for this lovely HUGE room with<br/>
fireplace. But if you want to find the special letterboxes hidden<br/>
WITHIN the Mansion, you will have to take the tour and gather up the<br/>
clues! Adults are $5, students are $3 and kids under 12 are FREE. If<br/>
we get enough people to sign up, they will consider giving us a<br/>
special discount rate! Now you can't beat that! If we get a huge<br/>
number of people, we will run another group at the 2 pm tour.<br/>
<br/>
You can still come to the gathering and do exchanges...plus find the<br/>
letterbox that is hidden in a graveyard on the property. But I hope<br/>
you will support this wonderful facility by taking the tour. It's<br/>
absolutely fascinating and just seeing the amazing silk braided<br/>
"paintings" of Jessie Catherine Kinsley, a member of the Community, is<br/>
well worth the price of admission. They even have a special tour<br/>
designed just for kids!<br/>
<br/>
So pack up your holiday leftovers ( turkey sandwiches, anyone?) and<br/>
come join us for some exchanges and special boxes. We'll meet at the<br/>
front of the Mansion House at 9:30 am (although you can park out back<br/>
where there is a lot more room for cars) and we'll begin by taking the<br/>
tour promptly at 10 am. After the tour we'll meet up in the Lobby Room<br/>
for some exchanges, our packed box lunches and the event stamp. Door<br/>
Prizes will also be given out. EVERYONE WHO TAKES THE TOUR GETS A DOOR<br/>
PRIZE! After this you are free to roam the grounds to find the<br/>
Taphophiles Unite! letterbox, or go after the many new boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and join us and meet your local CNY boxers? There are<br/>
many new boxers in the area so this should be a lot of fun. Everyone<br/>
is welcome to attend however ....bring your visiting relatives..they<br/>
don't have to be a boxer to come take the tour and hang out with us!<br/>
Come near, come far...just don't come late! :)<br/>
<br/>
Please sign up by Wednesday November 15th so we have a more accurate<br/>
headcount, as they will be bringing in special tour guides for us<br/>
depending on the numbers and we might earn a discount rate! You can<br/>
still sign up after that or even show up the day of the event, but I<br/>
won't guarantee you can go on the tour, get the special inside boxes<br/>
and earn a letterboxing door prize unless you sign up by the 15th. So<br/>
please help us out by signing up as early as possible! Thanks!<br/>

Best part is..it's weather proof!  We have nearly 40 people signed up, so not exactly a mini-meet anymore, but the fact that there are so many new people will make this an excellent time!<br/><br/>Also, it's great practice for some of the bigger gathers, where things are a lot busier with more activities and boxes. This will be a great time to meet other boxers, do some exchanges, and get a few boxes that are not available to the casual boxer, as the clues are not listed online and you have to do the tour to get the clues!<br/><br/>Anyone who has family who just wants to join us for the tour and bring a box lunch is welcome to come as well. So get those relatives off the couch and have them work off a little of that Thanksgiving
 dinner!<br/><br/>RSVPs for the tour are due by tomorrow, Wed, the 15th. You can still come if you aren't signed up by then but I can't guarantee a tour or a door prize or the special clues if you don't sign up. <br/><br/>LW Phd<br/><br/><b><i>June &lt;nfmoon@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-877920117replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-877920117ygrp-text"> <div> </div><div> <div>This website has a glossary that explains exchanges and many other boxing terms. </div> <div> </div> <div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterbo xing.info/</a></div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>missmoon</div></div>
