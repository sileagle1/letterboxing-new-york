this evening. <br/>
<br/>
But as for the rest of the gathering...it was GREAT! The park was <br/>
gorgeous and I will need to come back and explore more of it's 965 <br/>
acres. I saw deer, rabbits and blue herons. My trail mates (Catbead, <br/>
Jiggs and Dagonell) were wonderful company and expert boxers. We had <br/>
the boxes found, opened, stamped, and rehidden very well in record <br/>
time. Because of their expertise, I was able to add 30+  stampts to <br/>
my collection. I even hit the F-100 mark on Craftymouse's KISS MY <br/>
ACE. A truly wonderful carving.<br/>
<br/>
Daina and Kevin were the consummate hosts. The booklets were so handy <br/>
and I appreciate all the time that went into making them. It was a <br/>
wonderful feast (even if I did forget MY dish at home...Hungarian <br/>
Goulash for 20, anyone?) and got to meet so many wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
Catbead and I tried to catch a few more boxes on the way out before <br/>
it got TOO dark....( ok ok...I did get a COUPLE in complete <br/>
blackness) but by then we needed to head back. Meeting Tamsyn, Tony <br/>
and Phynstar at the Thruway stop was a nice surprise. Hitting a <br/>
raccoon at 75 mph was not. :(<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank everyone who donated items and boxes and great <br/>
food and conversation. And an especially big thank you to <br/>
Sprite...you did a FABULOUS job!!<br/>
