<br/>
Just wanted to say hello on this forum.  I'm a new-ish 'boxer.  I <br/>
live in the San Francisco Bay Area nine months of the year, and <br/>
spend the summers in Cooperstown, where I work for the Glimmerglass <br/>
Opera.<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared!  I plan to plant as many boxes as I can this summer.  <br/>
And I expect you all to come find 'em!  I've got five stamps carved <br/>
and ready to plant.<br/>
<br/>
So, here's a question.  In the Bay Area, nobody includes ink pads <br/>
with their boxes.  (I've only seen one, and it was in a hitch <br/>
hiker.)  It seems the consensus is that this would fall into the <br/>
accident waiting to happen category.  The 'boxers I know all carry <br/>
ink and pens with them.  Is this standard procedure in NY?  I worry <br/>
about ink making it through the winter, particularly as I won't be <br/>
able to check up on my boxes for months at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to meet some of you in Ithaca later this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
