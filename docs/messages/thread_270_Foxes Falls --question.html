Could you help me make my directions for Foxes Falls a bit clearer?  I <br/>
understand I may have goofed up regarding bridges!<br/>

<div>I am from Ilion originally and my dad still lives there. The road has been closed to keep partiers from using the falls and to cut down on ATV traffic that destroys the hiking trails. My father said the Ilion Water Dept owns the land but allows hikers to use it. He is a member of the Mohawk Valley Alpiners hiking group and they have often hosted hikes through that area. I have many fond memories of hiking to Foxes Falls as a child and when LisaScenic wanted ideas for placing boxes..it seemed like a natural. Lots of people know the beauty of the Ilion Gorge but not many know about Foxes Falls. Enjoy!</div>

<div>PS I live in the Syracuse area now but love visiting my beloved Mohawk Valley..hence my other boxes in that area. I am working on one now for the Fort Herkimer Church.</div>
