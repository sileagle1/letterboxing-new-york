We've been incorporating it into our weekends and all of our <br/>
traveling. <br/>
  I'm a transplanted NY'er from Rome who now lives in Indiana so we <br/>
travel back and forth a few times a year. We have some ideas for <br/>
boxes in the central NY area and are hoping to plant at least one in <br/>
the beginning of November on our next trip back. <br/>
  Anyway our question is this. What percentage of quests do you <br/>
actually find the letterboxes? On a recent trip to CA we attempted <br/>
15 boxes and found 10. It's very frustrating to us to be almost sure <br/>
we're in the right place and not find it. I always email the placer <br/>
and let them know we attempted it and where we looked exactly. On <br/>
only one occasion have we been told we were in the wrong area. <br/>
Anyways we were just curious if we're running about average for <br/>
attempts vs. finds. <br/>
  The whole letterboxing experience has shown us some beautiful <br/>
areas and taught us some very interesting history.<br/>

One other thing - how do you know if you find a hitch hiker if it's <br/>
not clearly marked. this past week we were in CA letterboxing and <br/>
found a known hitch hiker it was clearly labeled and had an email <br/>
address to contact. In another box though I found only an extra <br/>
stamp it had no writing on it no logbook. It did not seem to match <br/>
the stamp or area that it was in. We didn't know if that too is a <br/>
hitch hiker and if it was to be moved. Any info on this would be <br/>
greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance</div>

<br/>
So far we've been lucky and have only missed one box, our second<br/>
attempt.  On that one we searched everywhere, behind every single tree<br/>
within 60 feet of 'the tree', and were certain the box was gone<br/>
finally giving up.  We later learned that this box had been MIA for<br/>
some time, adopted &amp; replaced and is MIA again (duly noted on the<br/>
clues now).  Maybe the park people keep finding it....But the day was<br/>
nice, we had a lot of fun and wound up with some great photo's.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of the boxes around here (Syracuse) are in place, some<br/>
are pulled for the winter but the clues will say that.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HitchHikers are usually marked and come with a logbook.  Email the box<br/>
owner, maybe they put a bonus stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1749029668">Hi Cindi!   I  have to say that we have been successful about 95% of the<br/>
time.  And like you, when we don't locate the box we write to the placer<br/>
just to make sure.  Most of the time, it is something we didn't do "right" .<br/>
I will say, one time we found the tree that the box was planted under and we<br/>
froze in our tracks because the trunk and ground all around the tree was<br/>
covered in layers and layers of poison ivy.  Okay, I don't mind a little<br/>
here and there - I usually wear long sleeves and long pants - and I even<br/>
have a pair of rubber gloves in my backpack - but WOW, this clump was beyond<br/>
my dare!  So we were very disappointed not being able to get our hands on<br/>
the box - the trail took almost an hour to get to the location!<br/>
    But, it is all in the joy of letterboxing - that is how we look at it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of NY boxes waiting here for you when you come back for a<br/>
visit!!!<br/>

I would have to agree with<br/>
