You called it!  "Mr. Ranger-Sir"  (ala Yogi Bear) moved my box and sent me directions.  UNFORTUNATELY, I live nowhere near that area.  E-mail me off list if you want directions.  I'd actually appreciate it if you'd check on it.  It was our first plant, and my 7 yo designed the stamp, so it's rather dear to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Just out of curiousity, it the Evening Sail box missing or is<br/>
that the one that's been moved by the Park Ranger?  Wink,<br/>
Tarheel, and I attempted that one in early June.  Love to know if<br/>
it's still there, just in a different spot.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're able to get the clues updated.  Wish I could help. <br/>
It must be frustrating!<br/>

I have a problem I think is somewhat unique...For quite a while<br/>
now, I have<br/>
been completely unable to edit any of my boxes on<br/>
letterboxing.org. It<br/>
wasn't much of a problem at first, but as some of my boxes have<br/>
gone missing<br/>
(and one was MOVED by a "helpful" Park Ranger, who sent me new<br/>
directions<br/>
that I cannot post), I am now getting messages from people who of<br/>
course are<br/>
disappointed that they can't find the boxes. I contacted the lb<br/>
site<br/>
people, who tell me to lower my security settings or try this or<br/>
that, but<br/>
nothing works. I do have a Mac, and I've thought maybe I should<br/>
go to the<br/>
library and try on one of their computers. Would this work?<br/>
Should I have<br/>
them delete me entirely and start over? Suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, NYer's, do not go looking for Evening Sail, the<br/>
Bird of<br/>
Prey Series, or Lobo the Hobo in Lancaster. You won't find them<br/>
:o(<br/>

TIA,<br/>
