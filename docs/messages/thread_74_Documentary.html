<br/>
I am a video productions student at Syracuse University.  I came <br/>
across letterboxing by surfing the internet.  For this next semester, <br/>
our class is putting together a couple of documentaries.  All of them <br/>
are still in the proposal phase, but I was wondering if anybody would <br/>
be interested in helping me out.  I know it's snowy outside, but I am <br/>
quite intrigued with letterboxing, and I think it would make for a <br/>
really interesting story.  Could I enlist any of your help througout <br/>
the coming months?</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-756469767">Well, seeing as how I have experience with video production as part of my <br/>
job, and I'm currently taking a class in documentaries, I should be able to <br/>
help you. I'm not as experienced with letterboxing as some veterans around <br/>
here, but I know enough to be a good resource. Anything other info you need <br/>
I can get from the experts for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you want my help, let me know, and give me an idea of what info you need <br/>
for starters, OK? I do think it would make an interesting story, especially <br/>
since the information about letterboxing that has reached the general public <br/>
has only scratched the surface. Keep in mind that much of letterboxing's <br/>
appeal comes from the secrecy involved -- maybe you should keep that <br/>
idea/theme/mood as background for your documentary. Make it seem somewhat <br/>
like a mysterious activity (which it is).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I live in San Francisco, but I'm originally from Utica, and have <br/>
planted 5 letterboxes in Central NY (Utica-Rome).<br/>
