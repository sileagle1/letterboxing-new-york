<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Don't forget to research a little on personal 
travelers! Look at the list of people and see how many of them have PT's! 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I myself have 3! </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Also- watch your pockets and open bags at the 
gathering pavilion and on the trails...cooties are often jumping from person to 
person!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Make sure to check all your pockets and bags after 
the gathering, as well...that way you can ensure that any cooties you gather 
that you don't stamp and pass on are not lost forever!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you come across a hitchiker in one of the 
gathering boxes...stamp it quick, and take it to the next box you hit! Only take 
it with you if the gathering's long over, and you'll be placing it back into 
circulation relatively soon! It's not illegal to stamp the hitchhiker and leave 
it in the box you found it in! Just don't leave it in your bag for months on 
end!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">oh, and most important! HAVE FUN! I'll see you all 
in about 10 hours!</font></div>

<div>Oh I am so sorry to have missed everyone! We had the most horrible day. At 8 am, I brought Lucy and Clifford (my greyhounds) to the vet for a second Lepto booster and then we drove a mile to my parents' house for a run in their half-acre fenced yard. I figured it would tire Lucy out for the day and Clifford out for the long drive to Rochester. The greys got racing (not unusual) but unfortunately Lucy was not really watching where she was running--she was too focused on Clifford.  She clipped the bumper of my parent's camper that was parked in the yard (at full speed) and flayed herself down the side. :o(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We rushed Lucy to the vet and into surgery, and she is now home resting, although very sleepy and groggy. She has internal stitches and 28 staples, plus two drains. There was no way I would have been able to leave her sweet little pained face for the gathering. I've been playing nurse all day and I think I'll have to for the next several weeks, my poor baby--!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My apologies for missing everyone... I had looked forward to the Social and for all the wonderful boxes. I see so many of you stamped in logbooks and I was so looking forward to putting faces to names (er, stamps). I hope everyone had a wonderful and safe time (and had a better day then we did, arg!).</div>
