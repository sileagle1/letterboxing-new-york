hi, I do geocaching and don't know much about letterboxing, have <br/>
stumbled on 2, <br/>
both rather exposed, covered the first one back up, the second one I <br/>
found today <br/>
while hunting a cache at:<br/>
N 42° 44.268 W 073° 48.692<br/>
<br/>
the letterbox was in the fork of a tree and frozen in place, it looks <br/>
as though <br/>
someone stumbled upon it and broke it open as a cloth from within was <br/>
pulled out <br/>
and just left there, tucked the contents back in and covered as best <br/>
I could <br/>
since it was broken and still frozen in place, the letterbox had <br/>
something to do <br/>
with birds specifically the robin, just wasn't sure who to contact to <br/>
let know <br/>
that it is damaged<br/>
