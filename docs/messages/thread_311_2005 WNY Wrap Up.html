                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-193812609">Thanks to everyone that came for making this a wonderful weekend of <br/>
boxing! The Highlander and I had a ball Saturday and it seemed like <br/>
everyone left happy with the amount of boxing and socializing <br/>
available, which is all we ask for! We even had a great time Sunday <br/>
with Jiggs (sorry we lost you after lunch, man!), Craftmouse and <br/>
Dandelion. I just posted Mama Rose's pics to the AQ site and the new <br/>
folder here (plus I'll add them to our wrap-up page on our website), <br/>
but if anyone else has pics to share, please post them as well!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who donated boxes, food, raffle items and, of course, <br/>
money...we actually broke even for a change on the supplies and <br/>
pavillion! :-) And SUPER special thanks to my planting partners, <br/>
without whom we could not have done this...the IAP, Celtic Quinn, <br/>
Silver Dragon Quinn, Mama Rose, Judomon, Little Tiger and Dances With <br/>
Music (hope we're not forgetting anyone!).<br/>
<br/>
The majority of these boxes are out here forever, but ALL of them are <br/>
here for the next month, so feel free to return to the area and box <br/>
again. Keep in mind (now that you won't have a herd of folks behind <br/>
you as you box waiting to stamp in!) to take the time to rehide all <br/>
the boxes as well, if not better than you find them so we've have a <br/>
series that people can enjoy for years to come. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, we'll be sending the t-shirt money to the makers this week <br/>
and will contact all of you via AQ and this group when they finally <br/>
arrive. If you can still get money to us this week, we can still get <br/>
you a shirt, but e-mail us ahead of time so you'll know if we've <br/>
placed the order yet.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's it for now! We're gonna find a spot to night box in <br/>
October, but until then, how about a camping weekend in Allegeny NEXT <br/>
August? We'll check it out and hope to see you there for the 4th <br/>
Annual WNY Gathering!<br/>
