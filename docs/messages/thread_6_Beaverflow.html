today we found Beaverflow, near Great Camp Sagamore in Racquette Lake. <br/>
It was really a great box, in a beautiful area.  I would highly <br/>
recommend it as a day trip or if you are passing through the area.  I <br/>
was also surprised to see so many CNY stamps and adresses in the log <br/>
book.  I hope most of those people are a part of this group.<br/>
