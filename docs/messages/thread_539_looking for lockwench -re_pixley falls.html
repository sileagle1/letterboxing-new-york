Actually, if you look alittle closer, they LOOK the same but are NOT the same. They might start out<br/>
in the same area but have different directions to each box. All three boxes mention that you can<br/>
look for the  other boxes too. I just didn't put them in a series.<br/>

  Happy Hunting!<br/>

I'm not sure what you are asking,. but Ihave 3 boxes at Pixley Falls State Park. Pixley Falls, <br/>
Taske Me to Your Leader and Unidentified Flying Object. They are all listed for Boonville. If you<br/>

having to cut and paste my AQ clues for LBNA. I love the old time <br/>
history of LBNA but AQ is so much more user friendly and I love being <br/>
able to describe my boxes as kid or dog friendly, bring your bike, etc <br/>
without having to write that all out on a clue page.<br/>
<br/>
So I must have cut and pasted the wrong clue to the LBNA site. Sorry <br/>
about that. All better now. :)<br/>
