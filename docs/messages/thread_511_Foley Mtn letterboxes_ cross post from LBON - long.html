                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-378745906">Hi all, I met with Bond Strand today, the supervisor at Foley Mtn.  As<br/>
you may recall there were some issues about LB's and geocaches in the<br/>
park.  Guitarzan and I hiked to all the boxes last weekend to discover<br/>
3 or the 11 were missing:<br/>
Dancing Bear (mine)  Pain Au Chocolat (CraftyMouse) and FuzzyWuzzy<br/>
Fishbones (Nickleplate).  Bond had the first 2 which had been found<br/>
strewn on the trail, no bits missing and a HH in tact as well.  Today<br/>
Bond wanted to see where all the boxes were so I did the hike again<br/>
(about 2 hrs!) to show him the locations.  All of the hiding spots are<br/>
quite close to or right beside a trail and he had no problem with any<br/>
of them with the exception of Sheryl Crow which is under some<br/>
potentially dangerous dead branches.  So we chose a new spot, he will<br/>
in fact have his tree crew trim the tree and create a log pile to just<br/>
the hide the box!  He liked the creative aspect of letterboxing and<br/>
appreciated our willingness to cooperate with park staff.  As well he<br/>
asked if we might do a workshop and create some LB's for the summer<br/>
camp kids, he will be looking for a theme related to park flora or fauna.<br/>
As Hoover mentioned a policy is being created to address geocaching<br/>
and letterboxing, Bond stated he sees the 2 hobbies as being quite<br/>
different.  He particularly liked the location of Crafty's box which I<br/>
had hidden under the observation deck, stating that having a box so<br/>
accessible is good for the nonhikers.  I concurred but did not replace<br/>
it there as someone had scratched a big X on the deck above the hiding<br/>
spot!  Bond said he would get the X sanded off so that the spot would<br/>
not attract attention....  Crafty, I'll let you decide.  I can rehide<br/>
your box elsewhere and replace it with one of my own so that there<br/>
would still be a very accessible box under the deck.<br/>
He has asked that no more boxes be hidden on Foley for now so would<br/>
everyone kindly remove the "BYOB" from you clues.  There are other<br/>
nice spots in Westport to hide boxes, we can continue to make this<br/>
pretty place a real boxing destination without adding more boxes to<br/>
the park.  There will still be 10 active boxes in the park.  As well<br/>
please be<br/>
sure to mention the fee in your clue ($5 per car) and no night boxing<br/>
is permitted.<br/>
Would you please let me know when you have updated your clues...<br/>
Thanks!  Norasta <br/>
ps.  I have emailed Nickleplate a couple of times, no response.  Their<br/>
box is defintitely gone, anybody know how to reach them?</div>
