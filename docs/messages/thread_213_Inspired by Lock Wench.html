carving of 6 new letterboxes that I left on the New River Trail in SW <br/>
Virginia.  They're not too bad, but the real reward was my pride in <br/>
actually getting over the fear of turning out a recognizable image.  <br/>
So ... I have brought that new confidence home and have carved a bunch <br/>
of new stamps.  I hid two of the Carousel series today and will work on <br/>
getting more out over the next week or two.  So ... you can add <br/>
Binghamton to your destination list.  I've decided to have a sort <br/>
of "tithing" philosophy ... hiding at least a tenth as many as I find.  <br/>

A few of my stamps are pretty bad, and a couple of logbooks even worse..but no one really seems to mind. I guess it really IS all about the location and the hunt! And I am happy to know that I can spend some more time in  the Binghamton area as well. I was so bummed when I ran out of time and had to blow throught there a couple of weeks ago. And I am sure the folks in  the SW Virginia area will be pleased with your additions as well. Nice job!<br/></div>

<div>Yes, I too must give big round of kudos to LockWench! I wish I could be so prolific with my boxes! :o)  LockWench, you must have stock in all the art stores, LOL!</div>

<div>Scout... can't wait to "do" your stamps! I love your philosophy of planting vs. finding too!</div>
