not been letterboxing, but I also know letterboxing crosses your mind <br/>
then and again. So I ask you...are any of you buying letterboxing gifts <br/>
for anyone this holiday?  Are you outfitting a newbie? Buying something <br/>
for yourself? Buying for a letterboxing buddy? Enquiring minds want to <br/>
know...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe you're just tucked inside nice and warm.....carving away....<br/>

And Celtic Quinn knits?  Cool, you're quite a guy!  You would be the <br/>
second straight guy I've met who knits.  I've heard of more, but <br/>
they're hard to find as they tend to sort of hide and stay quiet <br/>
about it.  Apparently a lot of guys learned to knit socks in the <br/>
service during WWII, especially sailors.<br/>
<br/>
I am still thinking about my stamp to hide at a local spot for coffee <br/>
on Elmwood ave, but the Christmas prep has prevented me from doing <br/>
anything boxing related in quite a while.  I will be doing the family <br/>
dinner for the first time this year, and must prepare as much ahead <br/>
as possible this week.  Oh, and now that I've bought the presents, I <br/>
guess I have to wrap them before giving them out, huh?  Maybe this <br/>
afternoon if I can get off the computer.<br/>
<br/>
FIREBALL and I were talking about maybe combining cross country <br/>
skiing and boxing this winter.  I was going to hide my roundabout <br/>
series, but I don't think that's a very snow friendly location, so <br/>
maybe in the spring.<br/>

I have a friend in Rochester who lived and worked for five weeks the
summer before last at Steam Valley Fiber Farm in PA. In addition to
feeding and cleaning up after the sheep and goats, she learned to card,
dye and spin wool. She attended some shows and won some prizes for her
work. Her cost to stay at the farm was minimal. She now owns a couple
of looms and enjoys weaving. She loves what she's doing and that has
resulted in her turning out some truly beautiful work. I thought the
knitters among you might find that of interest.   ~R'nR<br/>
