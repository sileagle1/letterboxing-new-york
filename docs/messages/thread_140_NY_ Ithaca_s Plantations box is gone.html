<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I happened to walk by the location of this great box (the second I ever<br/>
&gt;found) last week and saw that it had been exposed due to an enormous tree<br/>
&gt;falling on and breaking the rock formation it was hidden in. The<br/>
&gt;landscapers at Cornell are very industrious and I knew the box would be in<br/>
&gt;jeopardy if left there while the tree was being removed, so I brought it<br/>
&gt;home and contacted the owners. I'm very sad to report that they've decided<br/>
&gt;to retire the box for good and I'll be giving it (and its three very full<br/>
&gt;logbooks) back to them on Sunday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those of you who weren't lucky enough to visit it, Plantations was<br/>
&gt;planted by TRIO in September 2001 and was one of the oldest surviving boxes<br/>
&gt;in NY (and hidden on a gorgeous little creekside path, to boot). Just in<br/>
&gt;case anyone had already printed out clues in anticipation of looking for it<br/>
&gt;while in Ithaca for the Finger Lakes gathering on June 11th, be forewarned<br/>
&gt;that the clues have been removed from LBNA and the box is gone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It will be missed...<br/>
