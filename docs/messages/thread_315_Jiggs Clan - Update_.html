<br/>
We caught a break on the car - it was the timing belt ($30 plus $240 <br/>
in tow, labour etc etc etc). Luckily, we own an older, rear-wheel <br/>
drive car, as the newer, transverse mount (front wheel drive) motors <br/>
probably would have seized to the tune of $2000!<br/>
<br/>
Silver lining in every cloud department: Mrs Jiggs and I were able to <br/>
meet up with Norasta and Guitarzan for coffeee when we went to pick up <br/>
my car. Seems plans for the Kingston gathering on the Coast Guard <br/>
cutter are well underway (ahem!) We're going to book a couple cabins <br/>
for Fri/Sat night as well!<br/>
<br/>
AND... new LBers in the area have planted more boxes  Woo Hoo!!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Pete aka Jiggs<br/>

<br/>
You must have been out beating up the trails when I put the flyers <br/>
for "Rocks, Docks and Locks" out!<br/>
<br/>
I can send you an electronic copy off line if you'd like...<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the event is the 27 May 2006, in Kingston, ON. The <br/>
gathering will be held on the Alexander Henry, a retired Canadian <br/>
Coast Guard cutter anchored in Kingston. <br/>
<br/>
The event is listed on AQ under "Events". You have to click on <br/>
display all events to see it. Any questions, you can contact either <br/>
me or Norasta.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Pete<br/>
