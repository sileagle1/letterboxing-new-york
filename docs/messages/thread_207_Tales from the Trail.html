                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2119055083">Well, our vacation in WNY is just about finished.  Unfortunately the <br/>
hubby kept us too busy for a lot of boxing &lt;insert sniffles here&gt;, but <br/>
we did get the chance to snag "Goat Island" and made an attempt at "3 <br/>
Sisters" before we hit the road.  Although we didn't find the Sisters, <br/>
there was a HH in Goat Island, which was a nice surprise.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be checking out shortly from the hotel ... I'm seriously <br/>
thinking of badgering him to let me go look for a couple of the <br/>
Williamsville/Amhearst area boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I've also decided that Soccerchick and I definately need to do a road <br/>
trip to Syracuse for the day sometime in the very near future!<br/>
