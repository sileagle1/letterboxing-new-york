<br/>
The reason I am bringing this up...if we can come up with a logo than <br/>
we can have some cool stuff. I recently attended my Alpiners Hiking <br/>
group meeting and one of our members put our all black logo on the <br/>
corner of a red bandana...and we were able to get really nice <br/>
bandanas for $4 a piece, and dog bandanas ( those triangular ones) <br/>
for only $5.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I love the idea of a patch too. Maybe a patch AND a <br/>
bandana? I had considered getting some bandanas for sale )at cost) <br/>
for Desperately Seeking Sun with the DSS stamp image, but then <br/>
decided it would be better to have these for a larger group, such as <br/>
LBNY. What do you think?<br/>

to try a design. Hope it gets more then one vote though...LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I know of someone who would be willing to make the patches and is good <br/>
at it...plus she's a boxer!!<br/>
<br/>
So anyone else? Chime in with a Yea or a Nay here. I'll bet some of you <br/>
are off drawing up a sketch for a patch right now!!!<br/>

already got it on T-shirts (they look great).  It is a VERY COOL <br/>
design, and it is an even better for a patch design.  There was a <br/>
bunch sold at the Mini-gathering, and I have yet to hear a bad thing <br/>
said about the design.  I think we should STAY WITH WHAT WE HAVE!<br/>

<div>Oh Lockwench, you should contact Spudhund! She is a graphics designer and did an AWESOME logo for our Greyhound Walking Club group (you can see it at the top of <a href="http://www.greyhoundwalkingclub.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.greyhoundwalkingclub.com</a>). She is a fantastic designer!</div>

IT! Or a baseball hat....  oh the possibilities! I reallly like <br/>
Sprite's shirt logo, and Dandelion and I practically LIVE in our LBNY <br/>
t-shirts. We wore them proudly when we went to the Pub Crawl. (Of <br/>
course, it was utterly freezing, so we were bundled under layers that <br/>
weekend! But we wore them nonetheless!!!) I'd love to have matching <br/>
goodies.<br/>

<div>I agree. Since we have that one for the t-shirts already, I think that if we have a patch, it should be the same one. </div>

I loved the logo we chose for the shirts, and think we<br/>
should be consistant.  As far as what to put the logo<br/>
on (shirt, bandana, etc ...), as long as it's not a<br/>
thong I'd buy and wear it<br/>
