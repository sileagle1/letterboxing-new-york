can ONLY be gotten by going to the event. They're<br/>
still posted so people can record their find that day,<br/>
but if you didn't go, you won't be able to do it. :-(<br/>
<br/>
The Box of Game Bones, however, is more of a<br/>
travelling event stamp. Those you might find at<br/>
another gathering, so they're not entirely off the<br/>
table as yet (in fact, I accidentally picked them up<br/>
the other day, so they're currently with ME!). Not<br/>
sure where CQ is sending them next, but I have to<br/>
return them to him first.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, from what i've noticed, most of the Event 
stamps are usually posted as traditional boxes. the AQ Cermonial one was a 
Mystery, because the event itself was a mystery thing. As for the box of game 
bones, that's a traveling event stamp, but is listed under mystery, because they 
don't have a permenant location, they go from gathering to gathering. Some 
traveling event stamps are listed as such in their titles, but i guess it really 
depends on what the author wants to post it as. I guess most of the time, 
research is in order.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah, i have a bunch of boxes int he area now, huh?
