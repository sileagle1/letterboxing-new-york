                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-683160983">After being housebound with three days of rain, I was getting cabin<br/>
fever.  On a beautifully clear, but cold Friday, I bundled up, ran<br/>
several errands and drove out to Royalton Ravine to finally tackle the<br/>
"Thankful" series that had been planted for the 1st WNY Gathering.  I<br/>
had been too busy socializing at the gathering to actually letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, after all the errand-running, it was already 3PM by the<br/>
time I arrived at the park.  I found the first 10 in the series,<br/>
realized that that beautiful orange-red sky to the west was actually a<br/>
sunset and tromped back to my car by 5:15.  It was dark by 5:30.<br/>
<br/>
The first 10 boxes are all alive and well.  No first aid needed.  A<br/>
few folk from the gathering had come back a few days after the<br/>
gathering to stamp in, so apparently I wasn't the only one too busy<br/>
socializing to letterbox.  If you think it was muddy and slippery in<br/>
November, you should have been there after three days of rain in<br/>
January.  I had on three layers of clothing and I was still chilled. <br/>
Interestingly enough, we've apparently gotten a boy scout troop<br/>
interested in letterboxing.  They were through just before Christmas.<br/>
 They didn't have a stamp so they used the stamp from each box to<br/>
stamp in and signed their troop number below it.  Someone must have<br/>
been carving as they walked, because later boxes in the series have a<br/>
crude stamp that the earlier boxes didn't have and they were dated the<br/>
same day.<br/>
<br/>
10 down, 9 to go.  A good day of letterboxing, not a great day, but a<br/>
good day.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Good thing you went when you did...those boxes are under a foot of <br/>
snow now! And I actually knew about the boy scoot troop...that was <br/>
one of our newest boxers, Ninja Rob (planter of the Good Oak LB in <br/>
Niagara County just recently). He took his group out there a little <br/>
while ago and reported that his boys really loved it, even the ones <br/>
who think EVERYTHING is boring. <br/>
<br/>
Just so you all know, all but one of the Rotary Park boxes have <br/>
changed since the gathering. Even if your were there before, the only <br/>
original box there is Dances With Fire (the rest had to be returned <br/>
to their owners). The ones posted NOW are permanent, so check here <br/>
for the clues <br/>

that I didn't bring a decoy squirt bottle of yellow H2o. &lt;G&gt;  I did<br/>
wonder if we'd see you in case you were out to finish the series, but<br/>
we pretty much had the place to ourselves.<br/>

Aaaar, more boxes at Clark for you!<br/>

sure if we'd be able to leave early enough to have a few hours of<br/>
daylight to box.      <br/>
<br/>
We got the first 7 boxes and by that time we were really cold and it<br/>
was starting to get dark, so we headed back.  We didn't want to be<br/>
stuck out in an unfamiliar woods, alone, in the dark.  Interestingly<br/>
enough we weren't as far into the woods as we thought.  lol  Just goes<br/>
to show that standing around the woods stamping in makes us think<br/>
we've walked a far greater distance....like miles!  Is there a<br/>
mathmatical equation for this?  (Fly Doc thinks we went thru a worm<br/>
hole!) &lt;G&gt;  Anyway we thawed out in the car and the 7 boxes were all<br/>
we nabbed.  I harbored hopes of doing all the Ravine and the other<br/>
Park boxes, but then I always harbor hopes.  <br/>
