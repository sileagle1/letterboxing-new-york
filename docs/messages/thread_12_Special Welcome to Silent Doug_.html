Rather than let him slip in silent and unnoticed, I thought I should <br/>
tell you that we're honored by his presence. Silent Doug is a very <br/>
knowledgable resource for letterboxing and has an excellent and <br/>
informative web site devoted to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
You can find it at <a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
The site has great information throughout it. I found it to be very <br/>
helpful when I began on my fast start letterboxing training program. <br/>
I see that he's now added even more. You'll find tips on getting <br/>
started, stamp carving for kids, how to plan a gathering, <br/>
letterboxing history, and much, much more!<br/>
<br/>
AND...(drum roll, please)... you'll want to check out all the great <br/>
letterboxing fashions (T-shirts to boxer shorts, and even dog T-<br/>
shirts), plus bumper stickers and other neat gifts to buy your Uncle <br/>
Paul (or your favorite letterboxers) for birthdays or the holiday <br/>
season!<br/>
<br/>
Please visit Silent Doug's site!<br/>
<br/>
So, Silent Doug, thanks for joining LbCNY - glad to have you with us!<br/>

<br/>
My first letterbox was actually in Central NY (in Ithaca), actually. And I <br/>
just got back from a trip to Buffalo this past weekend, with a stop near <br/>
Cortland to find some of Alafair's boxes and then several stops along the <br/>
Thruway to try the new Thruway series!<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to finding more Central NY letterboxes in the future....<br/>
<br/>
Doug<br/>
