                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-594247658">I know this is horribly short notice, but I want people to know that <br/>
the Trenton Falls gorge will be open this weekend (Oct 1 and 2nd) and <br/>
also Oct. 8 and 9th. This amazing series of waterfalls, canyons and <br/>
gorges is only open to the public for 2 weekends in the spring, and 2 <br/>
weekends in the fall, as the area is now owned by a hydroelectric <br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
I have a box located in a public area close to the access road and <br/>
Paul in SF has a box in a nearby town as well. I will be hiking the <br/>
gorge trail this Saturday, starting at 10 am. The trail is open form <br/>
9 am to 5 pm and takes about 60-90 minutes to fully appreciate. If <br/>
anyone would like to join me, you can meet me in the parking area by <br/>
the scenic trail entrance at 10 am. I will be starting the trail at <br/>
10:30 and then having lunch nearby (place to be determined). <br/>
<br/>
It would be a great time to do exchanges, do some hiking/walking and <br/>
photography and enjoy this amazing natural resource before it is <br/>
closed to the public again until spring.<br/>

I left you a message via AtlasQuest! I don't know what mail you are <br/>
likely to check before you head out today so,  I'm posting here too to <br/>
let you know I won't be making the hike to the falls tomorrow. : (<br/>
