<div><br/></div><tt>Well, this news of the MIA Atlantis box came on the day when 
I was going to take my niece who's visiting from NY to find it. I was going to 
implement a great idea from Princess Lea and keep the journal separate and dry 
in a different box nearby.<br/><br/>I can't say that I'm disappointed or saddened 
(except that Scott didn't get the reward for his hunt).<br/><br/>I  now think 
of letterboxes as being ephemeral (like flowers, sunsets, and cloud patterns) 
and they pass with time. For the Temple of Neptune box, it's VERY appropriate. 
According to the legend and lore, the box is probably not missing at all, and 
has just moved into the same psychic dimension that Tlamco still exists in 
[GRIN].<br/><br/>I created a rare underwater letterbox (possibly the first), and 
that makes me extremely pleased. PLUS, I'm sure I surprised ALL of you who found 
it by placing it not in a lake, pond or ocean, but in (of all things) a 
WATERFALL!<br/><br/>It will not be replaced, nor will Atlantis.<br/><br/>However, 
folks, please remember that there are other temples of Tlamco here, and the same 
time traveler that placed the letterbox at the Temple of Neptune may strike 
again at a different temple location.<br/><br/>Former Atlantean and Postmaster 
General of Tlamco,<br/>Paul in SF<br/>  ----- Original Message -----

Paul<br/><br/><br/>  PAul, <br/><br/>  Let me be the first to offer 
condolences for the lost Temple of <br/>  Neptune, I guess its karma wants 
it to stay lost to humankind, at <br/>  least at this time.  
<br/><br/>  I feel lucky to have found it before it went MIA. Sucha 
neatlocation, <br/>  great clues: the two keys and having to decipher the 
code, the <br/>  beautifully carved stamp.  It is a pity.  
<br/><br/>  HAving lost a few boxes now myself, I know it very 
disappointing.  Not <br/>  knowing what became of it: vandlas, animals, 
random acts of natural <br/>  forces is quite distressing.  Maybe some 
Ivy League researcher can <br/>  apply for a grant and investigate this 
topic more thoroughly so <br/>  letterboxers   can  design 
better boxes, or at least thwart the forces <br/>  of chaos from making off 
with them.<br/><br/>
