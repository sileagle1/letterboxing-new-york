the very best of people, and the letterboxes were just too fun!!! I <br/>
especially appreciate all the helpful hints I was treated to...I was <br/>
much too slow solving the clues for some of the company I was in!!!<br/>
LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Paul, you have a terrific family, no wonder you come back every year! <br/>
It was a pleasure to meet you!<br/>
<br/>
Best thing of all was, I GOT TO GO! I was so excited! My Letterboxing <br/>
Heroines, Lock Wench, Catbead and LisaScenic took pity on me and went<br/>
(way)out of their way to "rescue" me! I can't thank you enough for <br/>
such a grand time! Letterboxers are the best!!!<br/>

<br/>
Whaaat, how did that happen? Not to fear...I will be your way before <br/>
the snow flies, that's my lavender fleece in the back of your car!<br/>
