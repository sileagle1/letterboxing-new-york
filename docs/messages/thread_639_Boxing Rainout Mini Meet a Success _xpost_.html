<div>Christmas busy, busy, busy getting ready that's what up with us.  We have a new letterboxer in our family an 8 week old lab named Sierra and we hope she enjoys the hunt for the boxes as much as we do. With no snow this year at least the letterboxing is easier but we just haven't had the time to go and search except for LW's Christmas cookies and Under the Mistletoe I loved both.</div>

smoke a pipe of something [don't know if it was a rock of crack or <br/>
something herbal!  I've seen this guy @ the store before &amp; trust me, <br/>
he doesn't need to do any more of either one!]  Then he lay down or <br/>

couple weeks ago [gorgeous day, right before it snowed] but there was <br/>
a guy taking a break from his bike ride.  We sat in the car to wait <br/>
it out for a few minutes.  Knew we were in trouble when he pulled a <br/>
seat cushion out of his bag.  He ate two pieces of fruit<br/>
[pomegranates, seed by agonizing seed...Zzzzz], then proceeded to <br/>
smoke a pipe of something [don't know if it was a rock of crack or <br/>
something herbal!  I've seen this guy @ the store before &amp; trust me, <br/>
he doesn't need to do any more of either one!]  Then he lay down or <br/>
fell over, not sure which.  Figured @ this point that our trip was a <br/>
bust &amp; called it a day.  Haven't made it back yet but plan to.<br/>

activity lately.  Due to the fact that I'm now bigger<br/>
than the average-sized houseboat, I've gotten to be<br/>
friends with my Lazyboy and a pair of knitting<br/>
needles.  Soccerchick and I did head out a couple<br/>
times to get some of the newer Binghamton area boxes,<br/>
but I'm only capable of going a mile or so at a time<br/>
before I need a nap.<br/>
<br/>
But if this weather holds (clear and warmish), I may<br/>
just have to go out again over Christmas break ...<br/>

(sigh) Well, we've both been trying to wind down our respective <br/>
school years, Kevin's permanently and mine for the holiday. After he <br/>
goes to class once last time, he'll be recertified to teach and I'll <br/>
have a permanent sub living in the house! ;-) We're both taking the <br/>
last week of December off, during which we'll have my dad's mom up <br/>
here for a visit. We're taking her to the Falls and staying overnight <br/>
in Toronto (and hopefully leaving a box behind!). I've got quite a <br/>
bit to do I finally got lights on the house for the first time EVER <br/>
and we have a tree just waiting for Christmas sprites to dance all <br/>
over it (yes, sprites...butterfly and mothwings all over!). <br/>
<br/>
On the down side, I'm STILL trying to get the branches up from the <br/>
ice storm, so I'm hoping the weather holds out. (smiling sweetly) <br/>
Walter, if you have free time, you I could CERTAINLY use a little <br/>
help! <br/>

your neck. Also bring an extra coat or blanket and throw it over the<br/>
grill. Lay your journal on top along with a pen. Pretend to be<br/>
watching/photographing birds and pretend to "scribble" in your<br/>
journal. While writing with one hand, slip your other hand under the<br/>
coat/blanket-covered grill and search for the box. When found..hang<br/>
your binoculars or camera from your neck and stamp in. Trust me...few<br/>
people will bother watching you. Even if you are only 6 foot away.<br/>
<br/>
Move to another grill and do the same until you find both boxes. Works<br/>
like a charm.  :)<br/>

Anyway, my letterboxing has been not been prolific since early<br/>
November.  Maybe I'll get some over the holidays on our travel to the<br/>
North Country.  I don't mind the cold, and no snow to dig through.<br/>
