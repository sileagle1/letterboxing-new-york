<br/>
Wow! I'm excited to see our members have doubled in less than a week! <br/>
Yeah...now lets do that with letterboxes too! Some of you already <br/>
have a good head start...I gotta get crackin'!<br/>
<br/>
This has been a good letterbox related week for me! Besides the <br/>
pleasure of seeing this list grow, earlier this week I met up for an <br/>
exchange with Seth Mandeville of team Dynamic Duo from RI! (Ya gotta <br/>
love these exchanges...its refreshing to unleash a little enthusiasm <br/>
and not be regarded as escapees from the asylum!) Seth was here in <br/>
the North Country doing some salmon fishing and letterboxing...taking <br/>
his brother and dad on their first LB experience to my Lake Ontario <br/>
Dune Trail series! Score one new letterboxer and one, at the very <br/>
least, sympathetic observer... which as it turned out, was better <br/>
than the fishing results! <br/>
<br/>
And then to round out the week__ Team Frick'n'Frack went out <br/>
letterboxing today despite the rain! We did the Sterling Nature <br/>
Center Series(5) and "His Dark Materials" Series(6) in the Fair <br/>
Haven/Oswego area. If you haven't been there... both of these series <br/>
are well done with very nice stamps!  <br/>
<br/>
Upping my PFX thanks to many of you!<br/>

Let me say, I LOVED your Lake Ontario Dune trail Lbs!!!   My family and I<br/>
just did them about two weeks ago and we had soooo much fun!  We had the<br/>
places all to ourselves - it was awesome!  Your stamps are great!  Good<br/>
job - and the directions were perfect!<br/>
<br/>
My family and I just planted three new Lbs in Madison County - outside of<br/>
Canastota - come check them out.  As of last Sunday, no one has visited<br/>
them!!!  :-(<br/>

I'm glad you enjoyed them! <br/>

</span></blockquote>Yes, the beach can be just as enjoyable off-season as in. I'm <br/>
thinking these boxes will be accessible most of the winter (by skis <br/>
or snowshoes) because of the nature of the hiding spots, what do you <br/>
think? (Since you've been there one of the boxes has been moved to <br/>
its permanent location. The beach was too busy to do it this summer)<br/>
<br/>

one has visited  them!!!  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Don't you fret, I'm headed there this weekend in fact, barring any <br/>
complications!<br/>
