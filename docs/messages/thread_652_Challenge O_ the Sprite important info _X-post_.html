on this!<br/>
<br/>
Just to make sure everyone's on the same page, the Challenge O' the<br/>
Sprite (otherwise known as the Megastore Challenge) begins this<br/>
Monday! This challenge is in homage to TurtleMcQ's Challenge O' the<br/>
Sprite boxes that were placed inside a Wegman's grocery store, most of<br/>
which remained until the day she retired them. The idea is to plant a<br/>
box inside a store to see whose can last the longest. If you plan on<br/>
being a part of it, all you have to do is:<br/>
<br/>
1. Plant a box in a megastore. That means plant your box inside one of<br/>
those big superstores that has a place to eat inside it (Super<br/>
Walmart, Super K, your local big grocery that has its own buffet area<br/>
with places to sit and eat, etc.). Malls count, too, but you must hide<br/>
it in the mall itself, not one of the stores.<br/>
<br/>
2. List the box on AQ with the title "Challenge O' the Sprite: Your<br/>
Box Name Here". This will let us know to include you when we search<br/>
for boxes. If it doesn't have the title in it, we won't be looking for<br/>
it. E-mailing us to tell us to look for it will NOT help...neither one<br/>
of us can remember anything past times to eat and times to sleep! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
3. Keep track of your box. The last box to be muggled will win the<br/>
extra special Challenge O' the Sprite stamp and the admiration of all<br/>
your peers (such as we are!).<br/>
<br/>
The Highlander and I are going to plant Wally World today, so you<br/>
still have time. Once we post the official list on Monday, the<br/>
gauntlet will have officially been laid down, so get out there and do<br/>
some sneakin' around your local megastore!<br/>
