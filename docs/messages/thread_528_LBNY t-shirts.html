of us have (the one with the hiker logo on the front and the LBNY logo<br/>
on the back. If there's enough interest, I think we could swing another<br/>
order, but I need to hear from people first. You CAN buy them<br/>
individually from the distributor, but they're like $25 or so from them<br/>
and like half that for us. I have to check on the prices again, but if<br/>
anyone wants one, now's the time to speak up!<br/>
