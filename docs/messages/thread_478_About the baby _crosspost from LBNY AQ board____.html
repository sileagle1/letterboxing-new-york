so I'm reposting this from AQ:<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know everyone was really excited for us, but it looks like <br/>
this particular version of the baby project is going to have to go by <br/>
the wayside. The doctors are telling us the cells I had started are <br/>
actually regressing instead of developing and we have yet to see a <br/>
heartbeat, so they'll be doing a procedure next week to clear out <br/>
everything and start over.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little upset at first, but what I have are cells that had not <br/>
matured and are in danger of doing harm to my system now. In that <br/>
light, this is more of a new beginning than an ending, and as the <br/>
Highlander puts it "It's magic waiting to happen, so it hasn't really <br/>
left...it's just biding its time until we get the right form for it."<br/>
<br/>
So, we're okay, but maybe we should all hold off on any baby names, <br/>
boxes, events or anything for a bit (just so we aren't sponging off <br/>
everyone's overwhelming kindness without an actual kiddo to show for <br/>
it!). <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, thanks to everyone for your support...I don't think I <br/>
realized how important the boxing community was until now. Outside of <br/>
family and our jobs (who HAVE to know), you're the only group we've <br/>
shared this information with. :-)<br/>
