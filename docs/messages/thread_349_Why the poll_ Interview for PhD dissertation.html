Rubber Soul, which was about a proto-letterboxing group in the SF Bay <br/>
Area.  (I'll get you author and ISBN when I'm not writing from work!)  <br/>
This group did a form of mail art involving stamping, and was quite <br/>
structured in membership and format of the art pieces.  Intersting <br/>
stuff!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1963897907">How cool!  The letterboxes have that aspect of passing objects too in <br/>
the way that we collect images from eachother, from planted boxes, <br/>
but also from exchanges and personal travellers.  I found out about <br/>
letterboxing from Lisascenic, who has been my roommate every summer <br/>
for the past four years.  She was letterboxing, and would <br/>
conveniently try for a box in the area while we were out doing other <br/>
stuff.  The thing that really pulled me in was finding the Moss <br/>
Island Box, because it's in such an amazing place that I never would <br/>
have known about otherwise.  So Lock Wench finalized it for me with <br/>
her box and made me "one of us" (think "Freaks").  The other thing I <br/>
love about this is the idea that there's this whole other reality I <br/>
didn't know about before, that before I could have been walking past <br/>
these little hidden boxes that someone else knew how to find, but I <br/>
had no awareness of.  It adds another layer to the world around me <br/>
that I didn't know about, and of course now I'm one of the lucky ones <br/>
with the key to that layer too.  I also love that it's low tech and <br/>
art based.  Nothing makes me happier than a really beautiful stamp to <br/>
take an image from and then rehide.  So that's how I learned about <br/>
letterboxing.  I started out through a personal connection, and then <br/>
got clued in to the online group, and met Lock Wench pretty early on <br/>
because Lisascenic emailed about how cool her box was, and I hope to <br/>
connect further out to the other WNY folks if there's still a mini-<br/>
meet coming in October.  (There was talk of that, right?)<br/>
<br/>
So I connected into this through another person, Lisascenic, but now <br/>
she should tell how she got in, because if I remember rightly, it <br/>
wasn't intially people based but was more technology based (sort <br/>
of).  It'd be fun to track the connections back to see who hooked <br/>
who!  Hope some of this helps you track down the sort of info your <br/>
interviewer will be interested in.<br/>

<br/>
Rubber Soul by Sandra Mizumoto Posey ISBN 0-87805-903-2.  This is a<br/>
small book, about as thin as a magazine.  An interesting read, but not<br/>
a must-buy.  <br/>
<br/>
"Books in this series focus on the work of informally trained or<br/>
self-taught artists rooted in regional, occupational, ethnic, racial<br/>
or gender-specific traditions.  Authors explore the influence of<br/>
artists' experiences and aesthetic values upon the art they create,<br/>
the process of creation, and the cultural traditions that served as<br/>
inspiration or personal resource.  The wide range of art forms<br/>
featured in this series reveals the iportance of aesthetic expression<br/>
in our daily lives and gives striking testamony to the richness and<br/>
vitality of art and tradition in the modern world."<br/>
<br/>
Wide range, indeed!  Some other titles from this series:<br/>
<br/>
Punk and Neo-Tribal Body Art<br/>

 I have often shared the story that it was my mother that sent me the <br/>
Smithsonian article way back when..thinking it would be something I <br/>
would like. I was sooo crazy busy then (full time school, full time <br/>
work, raising 3 children as a single mother) that I set it aside. I <br/>
had looked up boxes in my county and there were 3. So imagine me <br/>
getting back into it this year and finding there were almost 50 boxes <br/>
in my county!!<br/>
<br/>
But I never really explained the appeal of this hobby to me and why <br/>
my mother thought it would be something I would like. As a child I <br/>
was dragged all over the country to historic places as both my <br/>
parents were history buffs. I was also raised by parents who were <br/>
HUGE outdoorsmen, so the woods and the mountains feel very natural to <br/>
me. I was always interested in arts and had been creating things <br/>
since I was little. So the combination of history, nature and art was <br/>
very very appealing. <br/>
<br/>
But the SECRET thing about this hobby is a throw back to stories my <br/>
mother used to tell me about when she was little. She was from an <br/>
extremely poor background and personally owned only two books as a <br/>
child..and one of them was about some little sneaky elves called <br/>
Brownies. She and her little sister loved the stories about their <br/>
adventures and my mother would continue their adventures herself by <br/>
making up bedtime Brownie stories for her sister. In fact, my mother <br/>
started doing little things for her sister and said that the Brownies <br/>
were responsible. This mesmerized my aunt (her sister) and my mother <br/>
kept it up until she decided my aunt was ready to know the truth. She <br/>
broke the news so gently to her that my aunt was not upset....she <br/>
wanted to be a Brownie too! So she and my mother started doing what <br/>
today is referred to as "Random Acts of Kindness"...and they would <br/>
leave signed notes from "The Brownies." Imagine their delight <br/>
watching people trying to figure out who was responsible for all <br/>
these nice things?<br/>
<br/>
I know my siblings and I were inspired to do this ourselves as <br/>
children and passed it on to our kids as well. Letterboxing <br/>
(especially placing) gives me that same feeling. I imagine the finder <br/>
locating my box and wondering about the placer. It brings back happy <br/>
memories.<br/>

<div>One of the aspects of letterboxing I am most interested in and would like to strive to protect is the "underground" aspect of the hobby. I feel this is being threatened by such things as newspaper articles, and even dissertations, scholarly and informative though they may be. Many people starting to box now seem to want the hobby to become "bigger and better"; "let's spread the word"; we have to get more people doing it". I would like to see it remain a hobby that people find by accident, the way I did, by stumbling onto the lbna site while searching for something else, (which is not that easy to do when the site is one of billlions) or finding a box by accident, or even having it passed on by word of mouth, one good friend to another fgood friend. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't want to see things like letterboxing on a recent web site listing of things to do in, I believe it was New Jersey? I don't want to see letterboxing becoming so well known and popular that park officials have to begin addressing it by creating rules and fees. Personally, I think this is the beginning of the end of the true uniqueness of letterboxing. In speaking to friends who box and reading the lists, I find that as more and more people start to box, there are more missing boxes due to the failure of people to rehide properly, more disregard for some of the common sense and polite "rules" of boxing, such as leaving nasty notes about clues in logbooks, even moving boxes to a perceived "better" location, going boxing with all the kids and taking up several pages of small logbooks to tell future finders where that families's boxes are planted and putting several large stamps of all the children on three and four pages of that tiny logbook.......simple, polite, considerate things that I don't think were done before in such profusion. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As more and more people can easily find out about letterboxing, more and more people who casually take up a different hobby every few months will box for a while, not see how special and truly unique it is, grow bored with it and continue on to something else, leaving boxes listed on the lbna site that will go missing for various different reasons that we are all aware of, the weather, vandels, animals, and leave those boxes listed for people to go look for and not find. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterboxing is a truly creative, unique, and even artistic "hobby", if that is indeed even an adequate term for it. I don't want to see it watered down, weakened and even eventually destroyed by publicity, until it becomes something Katie Couric does a three minute filler piece about on the Today show. Sometimes less is better. </div>

late."...... The mass media have discovered LBing and even if the only <br/>
way it spread was by WOM - LBers inviting friends to join in - the <br/>
growth would pick up speed as time went on. (Original LBer tells 1 <br/>
friend, so there are 2. Then they each tell 1 friend, so now there are <br/>
4. Then 8, then 16, etc...... never mind if they each bring more than <br/>
one friend in at a time.)<br/>
<br/>
However, there will probably always be secret corners of LBing and if <br/>
the secrecy is the thing for you, you may enjoy ferreting those out <br/>
instead of participating in the general hunt. It's just that now, those <br/>
corners may well be harder to find than when we joined what felt like <br/>
(but for anyone joining semi-recently like myself, really wasn't) a <br/>
secret hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows. Maybe when the media tires of LBing and Katie Couric has <br/>
done her 3 minutes, the appeal will start to fade away for the casual <br/>
hobbyist and it'll go back to something closer to what you'd like it to <br/>
be. It's happened in a million other hobbies - the media grabs a hobby <br/>
as the Next Big Fun Thing, big flash in the pan, influx of casual <br/>
people in addition to more serious hobbyists, publicity wanes, casual <br/>
people fade away. Just no way to know if or when it'll happen...... or <br/>
exactly who will find the effect positive and who will find it negative.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud and probably wrong about half of it...... :-)<br/>

That was almost amusing. At number 3 on the list of things to do in <br/>
NJ it rather gave the impression that we were the LBing capital of <br/>
the eastern seaboard.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to add that I personally am in no way responsible for the <br/>
proliferation of new boxers or an interest in the hobby. No one that <br/>
I've tried to introduce to letterboxing, family member or friend, has <br/>
had any lasting interest (or any at all) in the activity. Thank <br/>

to become "bigger and better"; "let's spread the word"; we have to <br/>
get more people doing it". I would like to see it remain a hobby that <br/>
people find by accident, the way I did, by stumbling onto the lbna <br/>
site while searching for something else, (which is not that easy to <br/>
do when the site is one of billlions) or finding a box by accident, <br/>
or even having it passed on by word of mouth, one good friend to <br/>
another fgood friend. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't want to see things like letterboxing on a recent web site <br/>
listing of things to do in, I believe it was New Jersey? I don't want <br/>
to see letterboxing becoming so well known and popular that park <br/>
officials have to begin addressing it by creating rules and fees. <br/>
Personally, I think this is the beginning of the end of the true <br/>
uniqueness of letterboxing. In speaking to friends who box and <br/>
reading the lists, I find that as more and more people start to box, <br/>
there are more missing boxes due to the failure of people to rehide <br/>
properly, more disregard for some of the common sense and <br/>
polite "rules" of boxing, such as leaving nasty notes about clues in <br/>
logbooks, even moving boxes to a perceived "better" location, going <br/>
boxing with all the kids and taking up several pages of small <br/>
logbooks to tell future finders where that families's boxes are <br/>
planted and putting several large stamps of all the children on three <br/>
and four pages of that tiny logbook.......simple, polite, considerate <br/>
things that I don't think were done before in such profusion. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As more and more people can easily find out about letterboxing, <br/>
more and more people who casually take up a different hobby every few <br/>
months will box for a while, not see how special and truly unique it <br/>
is, grow bored with it and continue on to something else, leaving <br/>
boxes listed on the lbna site that will go missing for various <br/>
different reasons that we are all aware of, the weather, vandels, <br/>
animals, and leave those boxes listed for people to go look for and <br/>
not find. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is a truly creative, unique, and even <br/>
artistic "hobby", if that is indeed even an adequate term for it. I <br/>
don't want to see it watered down, weakened and even eventually <br/>
destroyed by publicity, until it becomes something Katie Couric does <br/>
a three minute filler piece about on the Today show. Sometimes less <br/>
is better. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the reasons I'm collecting info from you on meeting each <br/>
other <br/>
&gt; is that I'm about to be interviewed by a woman from the University <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; Newfoundland for her doctoral dissertation in Folklore. She's <br/>
studying <br/>
&gt; modern pastimes that involve either passing objects from one person <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the other (mail art, or the traveling garden gnomes, for example) <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; people coming together around an object, such as a letterbox. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing, as a recently emerging activity, is beginning to be <br/>
&gt; documented as part of current history in the making. When you <br/>
consider <br/>
&gt; that this never would've occured in widespread form if it weren't <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; the Internet, you can see how it's an aspect of our social life <br/>
&gt; enabled by technology. However, it's basically low-tech, and human-<br/>
&gt; centered, and differentiated from geocaching as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The growth of this group is exactly what she's interested in. How <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; learned about letterboxing, and how we connect around the "object", <br/>
&gt; the letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd love to hear any of your thoughts and will try to share them <br/>
&gt; during my interview. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

Someone HAS read a dissertation!<br/>
<br/>
(As for the rest of you, note that I am not an expert on what your reading <br/>
material is.)<br/>
<br/>
However, I suspect you may begin seeing letterboxes with clues written in <br/>
Fortran, COBOL, C++, or even the forgotten Assembler language. Worse, you'll <br/>
have to drink rum and walk the plank with a parrot on your shoulder if you <br/>
fail to find therm.<br/>
