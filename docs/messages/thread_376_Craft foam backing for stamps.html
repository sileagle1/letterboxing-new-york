What a great idea! Thanks for sharing it with the West Coast!<br/>

extra thick (6mm) and extra firm, that make great stamp backing.<br/>

I can't take credit for the idea ( I got it a few months ago from <br/>
Catbead) but I love using it. It has made all the <br/>
difference...especially on those bigger stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I was using the thinner foam until Catbead showed me the thicker foam <br/>
that she uses...so now all of mine sport the thicker stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I just found some great little tupperware type containers at <br/>
Walmart's on Bridge Street in Syracuse. They are small (about 3 x 3 <br/>
inches) and came in a set of 3 for $1.50. Can't beat that! I will be <br/>
camoflaging mine. And yes, I still intend to plant..just not at the <br/>
speed I was before! But first comes maintenance and replacement.*sigh*<br/>

<div>Here's more info on the foam:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000">I use the foam as the backer, alone.
It's rigid enough for a backer and if I find an area of my stamp needs
extra pressure, the foam is giving enough to let me press that area
with a thumb and that usually does it. I mark the area on the foam
backer with a sharpie pen if needed and write something like 'press
hard here'.</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000"><br/>
Here's a link to see what the foam looks like as a door hanger,<br/>
</font><font color="#0000FF">http://www.stainedglassoriginals.com/kidscraftsupplies_doorhangers.h<span></span>tml</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000">It's the first image on the left, and
can be found locally in Walmart's crafts section, and crafts stores
like Michael's and A.C. Moore. Prices for the 1/4" door hangers
run from 3/1.00 on sale to 99¢ each regular price. Bigger sheets
about 6mm thick x 9" x 12" are carried by JoAnn Fabric and
cost just a dollar or two.  Cut the foam to size with
scissors.</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000"><br/></font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000">The glue I use is "Elmer's Craft
Bond 'Ultra Stix All" make sure you get the exact name, Elmer's
makes another glue with a similar name. I get it in Walmart in the
crafts section and Always squeeze it first before buying to be sure it
hasn't hardened in the tube, it has a short shelf life.  Other
boxers use a good quality (as in not the cheapest) 5 minute
Epoxy.</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000"><br/></font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000">Lately I've used "Terrifically
Tacky Tape" to stick the foam to PZKut, (found in Michaels Crafts
near the blank note cards, quilling? strips...close to the stamping
stuff like embossing powders &amp; ink pads).  Don't know how it
will hold up over Central NY winters, but a sample worked ok in my
freezer.  Terifically Tacky Tape is a package of two pages of 6"
x 8" double sided super sticky tape.</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000"><br/></font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000">When I use glue to attach the backer to
the PZKut, first I rough up both surfaces with my gouge so that the
glue can get a good bite. Then I'm sure to use more glue than I need
for a nice thick coat (like icing a cake); spreading with a putty
knife on the foam in an area larger than the stamp; press the stamp
down firmly/flatly and rotating it a bit to get all the air bubbles
out; I also - and this is important - leave a roll of glue around the
entire stamp (so it looks like a little bagel or inner-tube),
otherwise the glue will shrink when it dries and draw back under the
stamp leaving an uneven stamping surface. Lay it on a paper plate and
set it aside for a day, then trim up the excess with a blade or
scissors.</font></tt></div>
<div><tt><font color="#000000"><br/>
I use to stamp the image on the back of the foam before gluing, now I
prefer to write the stamp name and if there's enough room, my name
with a sharpie pen. If you do want to stamp the image on the foam,
then "Ancient Page" brand ink won't wash off, but you'll
need to heat set it with a heat gun or hair dryer.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,</font></tt></div>
