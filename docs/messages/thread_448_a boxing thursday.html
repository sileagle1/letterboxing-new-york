entered Remington twice but no Balloon Farm. Did you miss that one? <br/>
<br/>
Business in Salisbury?? I thought I was the only one that went there <br/>
for business! LOL  Actually, I go just north of there to load my car <br/>
with scrap wood from the Adirondack Bat Company...which makes great <br/>
kindling. Just curious, but had you heard of each of the locations, <br/>
then?<br/>
<br/>
I also spent a lovely day boxing. Pulled my two Christmas boxes and <br/>
retired them until next year....and went and found Hamlin Marsh and <br/>
Stefan the Wanderer by artichoke..and Bark at the Park by Trailhoundz. <br/>
I think it's so interesting that all greyhound owners are excellent <br/>
carvers....<br/>

***************<br/>
<br/>
When I was in art school, the school encouraged students to have dogs<br/>
and to bring them to the studios (safety precaution for late night<br/>
walks home).  Greyhounds were a favorite studio dog.  After a tough<br/>
life at the track, these sweet pups liked nothing better than to nap<br/>
in front of the heaters in the life drawing studios.<br/>
<br/>
I loved the other doggies, too, especially any really cuddly pit bull<br/>
terrier.  One friend of mine had pit bulls that would snuggle so hard<br/>
that they would knock you over.  When those dogs get enough love,<br/>
they're just wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm off to bed with my posse of pussycats.  I love the pooches,<br/>
but don't own any.<br/>
