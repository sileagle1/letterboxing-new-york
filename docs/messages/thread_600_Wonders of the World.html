Buggy and I had a whole lot of fun. The weather was just perfect, the  <br/>
trees were starting to change colors, I finally met a lot of people I  <br/>
knew only online and saw a few old friends, and the hunting was  <br/>
great. We didn't quite make it through all o fthe boxes out on the  <br/>
trail, but we tried. Oh, and Miss Buggy enjoyed the creek. :-) Most  <br/>
of the carvings put mine to shame - it's wonderful to see such  <br/>
creations. Maybe someday I'll be able to pull something like that  <br/>
off. [I forgot to write down the name of the carver, but 'I speak for  <br/>
the trees...' was absolutely stunning. Wow!!!]<br/>
<br/>
Two quick things:<br/>
<br/>
1. I think I left a dark blue windbreaker somewhere. If anyone found  <br/>
one, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
2. I have one unidentified stamp image..... it's small, less than an  <br/>
inch long, and looks kind of like a porcupine. If anyone can help me  <br/>
identify the name of the stamp and the carver, I'd appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful day. Thanks again to the organizers.<br/>

It was my first gathering and I was so impressed with the quality and thoughtfulness of everything.   <br/>
<br/>
I want to apologize, though, to the After World gathering folks: I left the event with the intention of finding a few boxes and then going to the dinner. When I almost missed a stop sign, I realized I was pretty fried from a full day of 'boxing, cooties (whoever put that one on my sunglasses made me laugh out loud when I found it), personal travelers, exchanges, trail stamps, etc. I had never even met another boxer before today so it was a lot to keep in my head. So I decided I should get myself home before I got even more tired. I'm sorry to not have said good-bye!<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am looking forward to meeting many of you again. Tamsyn — email me for a trail date and I will give you my phone #!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

met a lot of people and were absolutely amazed by the stamp qualities! <br/>
There were so many intricately carved stamps, and we didn't even have <br/>
time to find them all, unfortunately :(<br/>
  We had fun walking with Lord and Ladybug, and The Phoenix, and <br/>
exchanged with a lot of people we've only heard of online before. <br/>
Thanks for a great event, and can't wait for the next one!!!<br/>

Pam, the carver for that stamp "Voice of the Redwoods" was Aljan Sundance, of Grand Lake, <br/>
CO.<br/>
<br/>
I think the windbreaker was trying to find its owner at After Wonders; I'll check.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to finally meet you too!  Thanks for coming.<br/>
