like Fear Faketor...a day event of boxing on Saturday for those who <br/>
want to come in and out without staying on site and a two night camping <br/>
event with night boxing for those who want to stay overnight (Friday <br/>
will be just a check in night, while Saturday will be some night boxing <br/>
and more hang out time). The theme will be amusement park based, but we <br/>
will NOT be at the park...anyone interested can certainly go, though!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I need to know ASAP how many people are planning on staying <br/>
overnight (at least on Saturday) so I can reserve some sites and get a <br/>
set of boxes for the night event. Let me know ASAP if you're interested <br/>
(and let me know if you want to donate boxes to the event)!<br/>
