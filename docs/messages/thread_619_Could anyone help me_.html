part of the story and then choose which direction to take.  <br/>
<br/>
   I have started planning and writing a Choose Your Own <br/>
Letterboxing Series to be planted in Northwest Indiana. I am hoping <br/>
to maintain this series over a two year period. Since each box will <br/>
be extremely critical I have a feeling it will need constant <br/>
checking on. We are already planning on carving all of the stamps <br/>
(around 25) right now in duplicate. <br/>
<br/>
   I am hoping there is someone here that would be willing to <br/>
proofread the story for me. If they had any kind of a D&amp;D background <br/>
that would be extremely helpful since I would like to stay as close <br/>
to that "reality" as possible. It's been a very long time since I've <br/>
played seriously so my brain is a little fuzzy on some things.  <br/>
<br/>
  Does this sound like a fun series to you? I am considering only <br/>
posting the availabilty of the clues to those on the Great Lakes <br/>
Board (of course everyone here now knows so if it gets done and <br/>
you're in the area lol). I already have a Michigan Family that is <br/>
willing to test the series for me once I have it done but would <br/>
prefer they not know the story ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
   Thanks in advance and if anyone has any suggestions or ideas of <br/>
any other problems I might run in too I'd love to hear them.<br/>
