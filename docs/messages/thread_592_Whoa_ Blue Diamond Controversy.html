a strong opinion regarding the new Blue Diamond rating system, that I<br/>
was potentially making myself a target. That's the risk you take in<br/>
this country when you voice an opinion. But man oh man! LOL<br/>
<br/>
While I am happy to report that the AQ and regional list communities<br/>
kept their comments pretty much non-personal, you wouldn't believe the<br/>
volume of private email I am getting. *grin* But people are doing<br/>
exactly what I asked. I asked for people to write to me and share<br/>
their views on this new feature, as I was struggling to get my mind<br/>
wrapped around it..as I initially saw so many cons...and very few pros.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who wrote...even those who were nasty. I especially like<br/>
the person who told me I needed to attend a Weight Watchers meeting or<br/>
two. I am not sure what that has to do with Blue Diamond ratings, but<br/>
obviously I am out of the running for their own personal rating<br/>
system. Imagine my disappointment. :)<br/>
<br/>
But back to the pros and cons. I liked the fact that people brought up<br/>
some good points on BOTH sides of the issue. Things I didn't see at<br/>
first. Personally, I still am happy with my decision to opt out. But I<br/>
don't have any problem with people who decide to use the system. I am<br/>
a little sad, thinking that I perhaps won't get nice notes about a<br/>
visit to one of my boxes anymore...and may just get a rating that I<br/>
will never see anyway. But that's the choice I made when I opted out.<br/>
I can live with it.<br/>
<br/>
In deference to those who may not get a chance to toot their own horn,<br/>
or who are so new (or so experienced) that their boxes have not<br/>
received any designation, I would like to ask our community here.<br/>
Which box have you planted that YOU are personally the most proud of?<br/>
Doesn't have to mean a great stamp or a location, but it could. Just<br/>
tell us which is your alltime fave of all your plants and why. Planted<br/>
letterboxes are a labor of love for the majority of us, and I would<br/>
love to hear your stories. Maybe others would too.<br/>

<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">Never ceases to amaze me how nasty people 
can be.  It looks to be like it is simulating what passes for national 
discourse in our country these days.  I, for one, believe that people can 
discuss, have different points of view and still be polite and respectful.  
Hey, like I always told my kids, 'Different is good" :-)  It is always a 
shame when people can't articulate their positions and defend them without 
resorting to the childish and personal.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">As far as the Blue Diamond system goes, it 
is just another bell and whistle that doesn't appeal to my Luddite soul 
:-)  Next time I venture over to AQ, I will probably disable the feature on 
my boxes, if I can figure out how to do so :-).  I know that some love all 
the little features and (what I think of as) fou-fous that make up AQ, but I 
find myself using that site less and less.  I would even venture to say 
that if LBNA ever adopts a mileage-focused locator like AQ, my visits to AQ 
might drop like a precipice.  Not because I don't think the site is great, 
because I think by any measure, AQ is a phenomenal site and quite a marvel in 
programming, but it's bells and whistles fit in less and less as to 
how I 'play the game' lately.</font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">My favorite box(es) planted would have to be 
The Seven Wonders.  It is a long hike (almost 12 miles, which I like), in a 
beautiful location,  but because it is on jeep trails, it is drivable 
by car, atvs or bikes.  This series takes you by an old cemetery with many 
early graves and several lakes, one with a cool 'causeway' that 
you hike across to retrieve one of the boxes.  What makes these my 
favorites though are the stamps.  The carvings are simply 
magnificent.  The 8 stamps were carved by Budgie, Seekher, Spudhund, 
Trailhoundz and myself.  The three I carved, of course, are the lesser and 
more amateur ones :-/.  From the comments I have received about these 
stamps, it is clear that the finders appreciate the quality and the care that 
went into the design and carving of them.</font></div>

I think AQ should also add "Green Clovers" for when a letterbox is <br/>
hidden so well that you'll be 'lucky' to find it. And how <br/>
about "Yellow Moons" for when the box is only accessible on the <br/>
fifth waning moon of a leap year.<br/>
<br/>
What about the rest of the Lucky Charms?<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe there was a NEED for this blue diamond feature to be <br/>
implemented. It's certainly not my cup of tea, or bowl of lucky <br/>
charms, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know letterboxing was about competition.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1377237071">LOL  You guys are too much :)  But don't worry about me receiving nastiness. I DID ask for people to contact me privately with their opinions. And I DID put myself into the arena. Luckily, I still have all that "thick skin" that my "admirer" mentioned...so I should be good to go. *grin*<br/><br/>I just want to let y'all know that I won't be rating your boxes. No offense, but obviously the system is not going away, and obviously it is not accurate yet and Ryan has no way of predicting when it would be. I would rather just write a personal note to each of you and let you know how I enjoyed the outing/box/stamp/location, whatever... as I don't have enough finds to make my opinion carry any real weight in the scheme of things. I am more of a "One Man, One Vote, All Votes Count the Same"  kind of girl.I  will continue to make personal recommendations of boxes to visitors, however...as I think THAT system was working just fine and didn't need any help. You
 should also know that numbers of hits on your clue pages gives you a better chance of earning a diamond, if that is something that interests you. Having every person you know rank your box high will help your chances too. Am I advocating this? Heck no.<br/><br/>I am just glad I opted out for a lot of reasons.  The thought of some poor sap  from out of town with one hour to spend going to ONE of my previously listed "Blue Diamonds" made me sick to my stomach. It got a lot of hits simply because people were curious about the name and several people  mentioned it in a post.   And my truly best efforts got nary a mention. A system is only good if people can put their trust in it....and I, for one, cannot. Nor am I content with people having to depend on such a system for recommendations until enough people actually find my boxes and report back. I do not live in a letterboxing mecca, and it could take YEARS to get enough votes to make a difference. No
 thanks.<br/><br/>But that's not even the real problem. The real problem is that once again, newbies are given the short end of the stick. If they don't have enough finds, then they are considered too inexperienced to judge a fantastic box when they see one and so their vote doesn't count as much.... while people who have TONS of finds are allowed to impart their "wisdom" on us once again. No thanks.<br/><br/>As for missing/retired boxes? Just take comfort in the fact that enough people still enjoyed it to rank it highly when it was around..or give it a lot of clue hits for whatever reason. If someone with a lot of finds found it and voted..that person's opinion helped you even more.<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><b><i>songchick &lt;songchick_66@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1377237071replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1377237071ygrp-text"> <div>What about the new horseshoes?

disagree.  The above is simply not true.  I know<br/>
because I asked Ryan.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
HEre is what he said.<br/>
<br/>
"The number of hits on a clue page has absolutely<br/>
nothing to do with the rating. It's possible those<br/>
clue pages with lots of hits also get more finders and<br/>
therefore more votes and therefore could possibly end<br/>
up getting blue diamonds (assuming the votes come in<br/>
high), but that's a pretty thin thread in my book. AQ<br/>
doesn't even look at the number of hits on a clue page<br/>
in the calculations."<br/>
<br/>
and for the second thing:<br/>
<br/>
"Having every person you know rank your box highly<br/>
would certainly help your chances, but it could<br/>
backfire if AQ figures out you're trying to beat the<br/>
system and punishes your score as a result."<br/>
<br/>
There's an algorithm built-in to discourage this kind<br/>
of score-plumping.<br/>

&gt; It got a lot of hits simply because people were<br/>
&gt; curious about the name and several people  mentioned<br/>
&gt; it in a post.  <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Well, don't feel sick about it, because it didn't get<br/>
a high rating because of the hits.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way.  If you're a teacher and have 3<br/>
students, and a teacher with 30, and a teacher with<br/>
300.... you're still going to get an "average" on your<br/>
teacher rating score.  Doesn't matter how many<br/>
students you get, that's not going to affect your<br/>
rating average.  And in the smaller examples, if one<br/>
whacko student gave you all 1's or all 10's, there is<br/>
a way of normalizing that out of the statistics, so it<br/>
still doesn't matter that it's a smaller sample.<br/>
<br/>
Make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And my truly best efforts got nary a<br/>
&gt; mention. <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Maybe what you think is a best effort isn't what the<br/>
masses think is a best effort? I mean, on my boxes, no<br/>
one listed what I think is my best, meaning, most fun,<br/>
best hides, best put together clues and page, as a<br/>
Blue Diamond, yet another -- which I admit is a very<br/>
sweet little clue and cute spot, got a BD even though<br/>
it's a *gasp* store bought stamp!  Which actually<br/>
makes me LIKE the BD system ever more... seeing how it<br/>
shook out in my own boxes.  I like that my own<br/>
personal opinion doesn't get to be the be-all and<br/>
end-all, kwim?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A system is only good if people can put<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their trust in it....and I, for one, cannot. Nor am<br/>
&gt; I content with people having to depend on such a<br/>
&gt; system for recommendations until enough people<br/>
&gt; actually find my boxes and report back. I do not<br/>
&gt; live in a letterboxing mecca, and it could take<br/>
&gt; YEARS to get enough votes to make a difference. No<br/>
&gt; thanks.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Again, you're operating on a faulty assumption....<br/>
that numbers are what matters.  Does that change the<br/>
above?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But that's not even the real problem. The real<br/>
&gt; problem is that once again, newbies are given the<br/>
&gt; short end of the stick. If they don't have enough<br/>
&gt; finds, then they are considered too inexperienced to<br/>
&gt; judge a fantastic box when they see one and so their<br/>
&gt; vote doesn't count as much.... while people who have<br/>
&gt; TONS of finds are allowed to impart their "wisdom"<br/>
&gt; on us once again. No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Now.. see.. it feels like you're just looking for<br/>
things to take umbrage at. :-)  IS that really such a<br/>
big deal? I mean... out of thousands... it all evens<br/>
out in the wash.  Individuals dont really matter in<br/>
such a big system.. In fact it's much more "fair" in a<br/>
sense than someone asking on a list "what are the best<br/>
boxes", considering many people don't have much time<br/>
to spend on lists like this... only the squeakiest<br/>
wheels would get to recommend boxes?  Why does someone<br/>
who posts a lot on a local list get to have a better<br/>
opinion than someone that doesn't?  SEe we can go<br/>
round and round on this...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As for missing/retired boxes? Just take comfort in<br/>
&gt; the fact that enough people still enjoyed it to rank<br/>
&gt; it highly when it was around..or give it a lot of<br/>
&gt; clue hits for whatever reason. If someone with a lot<br/>
&gt; of finds found it and voted..that person's opinion<br/>
&gt; helped you even more.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Not really.  I think you should talk to Ryan about<br/>
this.  I don't like the idea that misperceptions like<br/>
this are spiralling out and around to all the myriad<br/>
local lists where he can't even see what's being said<br/>
and therefore correct the misperceptions... not that I<br/>
don't think we can talk about this here, but it makes<br/>
me worried that ppl will make judgements about the<br/>
system based on just reading these posts.<br/>
