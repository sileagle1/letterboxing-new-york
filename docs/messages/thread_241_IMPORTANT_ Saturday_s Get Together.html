Barneveld! Anyone coming my way???(ie. down Rt 12, or headed to the <br/>
Great Swimming Hole Caper Lbx) I am a mile and a half off Rt 12 and <br/>
only a half mile from that stop sign on the way to Lock Wench's box!<br/>
If <br/>
you are in my vicinity and can rescue me, here are the directions!<br/>
Take <br/>
Rt 28 south from the Mapledale Business District appx. 1 1/2 miles <br/>
where you will see stone pillars on your right with a sign "Trenton <br/>
Assembly Park", #8301. after passing the mail kiosk and rounding the <br/>
bend, turn in the first drive. My cottage is #43. PLEASE drive at a <br/>
crawl, the speed limit is 10mph!<br/>
<br/>
If by chance you can pick me up (and deliver me back again),post a<br/>
note <br/>
here so no one else comes! Once I leave the library I will again out<br/>
of <br/>
touch (no phone either, I Jimmy Hoofa'd that last week while pouring <br/>
sidewalks I suspect!) <br/>
<br/>
Did I mention I have A WOM clue to distribute if I get to the <br/>
gathering!! <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately picking me up might spoil some of the fun for my<br/>
rescuer! <br/>
But then again they might get the first finders prize!<br/>
<br/>
Way past plans A,B,&amp; C !<br/>
