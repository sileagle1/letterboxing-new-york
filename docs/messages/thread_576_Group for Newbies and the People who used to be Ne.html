This is a group where you can ask those questions and not feel stupid<br/>
or out of touch. It's a good thing to explore the LBNA archives,<br/>
talklists and Atlasquest glossaries and such. But if you can't find<br/>
the answer you seek, please ask us on the Newboxers group list! We go<br/>
over some of the same questions over and over but it's all good. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, each and every one of us was a Newbie first. Here's the link:<br/>
