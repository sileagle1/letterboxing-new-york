actual apocalypse, and it's really hard to look non-chalant reaching <br/>
into the bushes for it when there's a dragon around!  Plus, I don't <br/>
think I'm good enough to carve armagedon.  I would definately need <br/>
more pink stuff.  lisascenic could probably do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you like reading funny books about the end of the world (and who <br/>
doesn't?) I'd recommend you check out "Good Omens" but Neil Gaiman <br/>
and Terry Pratchit.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1079968154">Okay, we finally took a break from the attempts at babymaking (which <br/>
has involved too many doctors and nurses to be as enjoyable as it <br/>
sounds!) to box a little again today. We actually DID head to Studio <br/>
Arena and found the Man in Black, then went off to find CQ's hostel, <br/>
which has apparently disappeared! I hope for his sake it's still <br/>
around, but that hole looked MIGHTY empty at last check... :-(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as we drove around town and I started noticing all the <br/>
historical and other such places I really love (Teddy Roosevelt <br/>
Inaugural site, Shea's, Forest Lawn, St. Louis Church, the Naval Park, <br/>
etc), I was suddenly struck with a desire to start a new series. I was <br/>
thinking of calling it Sights and Sounds of Buffalo until I realized <br/>
that a few of the places are outside Buffalo proper (and even outside <br/>
Erie County!). Also, I have no sounds of the area except the <br/>
Highlander's flatulence...so, as soon as I make my KEvin Smith PLB <br/>
stamp, the WNY Travel Log series kicks off! I'm not sure what stamp <br/>
I'll make first, but it'll be something urban, I'm sure (boxes out in <br/>
the wild are really nice, but urban boxes give you the REAL cloak and <br/>
dagger feel!).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Highlander has FINALLY taken up the carving tool again and is <br/>
doing his own dragon series. Both of us are sitting fireside and <br/>
carving tonight...honestly, you can't put a price on finding a common <br/>
interest with your loved ones!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the Speedycut and tracings...!<br/>
