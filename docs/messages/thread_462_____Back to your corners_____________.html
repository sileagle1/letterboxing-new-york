toss in my 43 cents.....and....maybe, yes, piss some people off, but <br/>
hey.....that's me.  I have to say that I think Lock Wench hit on <br/>
something (unknowingly, perhaps) that I think we should, again, take <br/>
to heart.  Head to your own corners :)  Huh?  Yhea, why can't there <br/>
be a LbWNY and LbCNY again??  I'd like for Phinster to start a LbENY <br/>
site. There is more than enough people there to do so. Why the hell <br/>
isn't there a LbNYC site?  There is a huge pool of people AND boxes <br/>
there.  LbLI is waiting to happen on the island, just as LbADK seems <br/>
to be waiting up in the big hills to our north.  Same, same with <br/>
LbCAT (or whatever the Catskills would be called).<br/>
<br/>
It is noble to want to be unified under one roof, and now we are :)<br/>
Sometimes boundries, borders and lines are drawn/placed/occur <br/>
naturally for the good of all.  This allows for relationships and <br/>
rivalries (both good) to develope.  I love the fact that we all want <br/>
to hug as NYers, but we aren't all the same.  We (I sure do) need <br/>
our own space, as well as being identified as something bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, New York state is broken into regions for many, many <br/>
reasons.  We can, and should keep LbNY, but regionality is what <br/>
makes us all great (Is it soda or is it Pop?).  The LbWNY and CNY <br/>
sites never should have gone away.  We the people (that's the <br/>
teacher in me) should have simply  made a new site.  There are <br/>
PLENTY of other places that have 1, 2, 3 sites that cover the same <br/>
place.  Maine has a site as Conn.  Both are under the LbNE.  Who <br/>
cares if there is more sites.  To me it's just more fun to hear <br/>
about people being out Lbing.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
Central Ohio has it's own site.  Western Maryland too.  Think about <br/>
NYS tourism.....There is a Dept/Board/Office  for the whole state, <br/>
more for all the regions, further more for each of the counties, and <br/>
then cities have their own.  Nobody complains.  How often do we <br/>
cross-post on different sites for Lbing????  I check Lb sites from <br/>
all over the country.  I like to hear about the different ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
YES!!!  We should all head to our corners, and dig what we have.  It <br/>
isn't going to make us a lesser boxing state, in fact it will spruce <br/>
us all up.  I'd join ANY group in NY.  I am in Saratoga (I have a <br/>
box planted there with another to come in the spring *Thanks <br/>
In'laws*) all the time.  To me that's Hello LbENY for me.  My <br/>
brother In-law is on the Island, and I'm in NYC constantly.  I'd <br/>
join those too. I'm headed to the ADKs next week :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Sprite, we HAVE a Design/Logo/emblem for LbNY.  I look <br/>
forward to having it on a patch.  It looks great, and has already <br/>
been agreed/voted/decided on a time ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Folks, this is a HOBBY.  It is supposed to be fun.  I, for one, <br/>
believe that there is nothing wrong with "being sent to our <br/>
corners".  I kinda like the idea :)<br/>
<br/>
I don't always agree with what is correct, but I will always stand <br/>
up for what is right.<br/>

<div>Since I'm snowed here and keep going back and forth to the computer, I'll throw mine in also. I think anyone is free to start any regional list they want to and I don't see any problem with it. I don't there there should be any competition with the LBNY list. None of these lists should be competing with each other. There's no reason for it. I think there is room for all. It :::is::: a big state with a lot of different regions. And I think people really feel at home on a local list. I think this list is great, but I wouldn't call it a local list since it was created to cover the whole state. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have thought about starting a LBNYC list, but I didn't think there were enough people to keep it active.  We have "a huge pool of people and boxes here"???? &lt;s&gt; Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one. But then I whine a lot. But I do feel pretty much alone down here most of the time. Most of the people who do my boxes are from someplace else. Not all, but most. And there isn't exactly a crowd of people placing boxes here, maybe because urban boxing can be so frustrating at times. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I seem to actually be calling the LBMA list more of a home than this one because someone told me about it, said people from New York posted, and said I should join, so I did and started feeling at home there before this list was made. </div>

<div>The last time I tried to get them to remove some of my boxes because they needed to be edited (there is no edit feature) I never got an answer from them and the last time I looked the boxes were still listed with the old clues that are no longer good. Actually I've written to them more than once and never gotten a reply. Their main efforts go toward the hijacker site itself. Maybe I'll look again and write again if there haven't been any changes. And that's just a list of boxes, not a place to post. We city folk need a place to post and whine!!! lol When I first found that site, I thought it was great but since I couldn't edit stuff or get a response, I never put anymore boxes on there.  I always hope no one looks for my boxes based on the clues there. missmoon</div>
