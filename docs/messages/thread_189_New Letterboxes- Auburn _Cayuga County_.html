<div>Hi all...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just finished planting my second series of letterboxes. These are along the Auburn-Fleming Trail in beautiful Auburn NY. :o)  They are called  "Historic Auburn NY I".  You can find the clues at <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=15919&amp;boxname=Historic_Auburn_NY_I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=15919&amp;boxname=Historic_Auburn_NY_I</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>and I'll also post them below. :o)</div>

The actual trailhead is on Dunning Avenue, but we placed these boxes backwards (beginning on Rt. 34) since the Dunning Avenue side has a steel grate bridge thats difficult for paws to cross!<span style="">  </span>There are no ink pads in these boxes; please bring your own ink and pen.</font></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">From the north: Rt. 34 through the city of Auburn. Pass BOCES school on the left, then Silver Street on the left, then Sand Beach Road on the left. The trail begins in between the yellow Buses sign and the 45 MPH sign on the right, in a small grove of woods.<span style="">  </span>Its VERY easy to miss keep your eyes peeled!<span style="">  </span>Park on the shoulder of the road (most people do this) near the entrance to the trail OR park across the street at the Sunoco Station/Dacys Automotive/E&amp;V Propane parking lot (please park to the side to give courtesy to customers).</font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy"> </font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">From the south: Rt. 34 through the hamlet of Fleming. Speed limit increases to 55 MPH after the hamlet.<span style="">  </span>After a few miles, you begin to enter the outskirts of Auburn and must slow down to 45 MPH.<span style="">  </span>The trail entrance is across the street from Dacys Automotive and Sunoco Gas Station. Park on the shoulder of the road (most people do this) near the entrance to the trail OR park across the street at the Sunoco Station lot (please park to the side to give courtesy to customers).</font></p>

<h2 style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy" size="3">Box 1: Seward House</font></h2>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">Se<i>ward House is named for William H. Seward, former Secretary of State, who moved to Auburn in 1823 to marry Frances Miller.<span style="">  </span>At 29, he was elected to the New York State Senate and in 1838 became governor of New York. Devout abolitionists, the Sewards used their home on South Street as a stop along<span style="">  </span>the Underground Railroad, and were financial backers of Harriet Tubman on her raids in the south. When Abraham Lincoln became President, Seward was appointed Secretary of State where he was part of an assassination plot on himself and the President (President Lincoln, as we know, did not survive; Seward survived but was scarred for life). William H. Sewards lifetime accomplishments include helping draft the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863,<span style="">  </span>bringing California to the Union as a free (not slave) state, and purchasing the Alaska Territory from Russia.</i></font></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">Begin down the trail (please note that the farmland on both sides of the trail is privately owned, so heed to the Posted signs).<span style="">  </span>Youll pass an opening in the trees on the right; beyond the meadows you can see a white house sitting on the hill.<span style="">  </span>Continue on. Youll eventually come to a small path that cuts across the trail.<span style="">  </span>Cross this and continue on. You will come to a large opening in the brush on your left, which exposes beautiful green farm fields and some red barns in the distance.<span style="">  </span>About 25 steps beyond this opening, also on the left, youll notice a large white birch tree that wears a faded Posted sign. Across the trail (on your right) youll notice two trees that come out of the ground very close together, kind of forming a V.<span style="">  </span>One tree is rough barked and the other is grey with rough grey stripes. Beneath these trees youll find Box #1, Seward House.<span style="">  </span>Please rehide the box well after stamping.</font></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><em><font face="Goudy">Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, beautiful Willard Chapel was completed in 1849 as part of the Auburn Theological Seminary. The Chapel contains the only unaltered Tiffany religious-related interior in the world.<span style="">   </span>Founded in 1818 by Presbyterians, the seminary worked across denominational lines to prepare clergy for the American frontier and foreign missions. Faculty participated in the great social movements of the time: the struggles against slavery and for women's suffrage, temperance, and reforms that uplifted the poor. Auburn was one of the first theological schools in the country to educate women and to enroll students from Asia. Although Willard Chapel still remains in the heart of Auburn, the actual seminary moved to New York City shortly after the Great Depression and is still<span style="">  </span>training clergy in the upper west section of Manhattan.</font></em></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">Continue down the trail.<span style="">  </span>Cross over a wooden plank bridge. Cross a wide tractor path that cuts across the trail from one field to the other look both ways before crossing! :o) Notice the quiet stream and swampland, and huge, gnarled swamp trees, that begin on your left. Eventually youll walk by a posted trail on your right.<span style="">  </span>Keep walking and youll come to a wooden bridge that crosses over a quiet, barely moving stream.<span style="">  </span>Cross the bridge.<span style="">  </span>On the left pier youll find Box #2 (please be careful!).</font></p>

<h2 style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy" size="3">Box #3: Harriet Tubman Home</font></h2>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><em><font face="Goudy">After escaping slavery in Maryland in 1849, Harriet Tubman made 19 treks into the dangerous south, freeing over 300 enslaved people and leading them to freedom.<span style="">  </span>Her bravery and daring led her to gain the moniker, Moses of her People.<span style="">  </span>During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union as a nurse, scout, and spy.<span style="">  </span>She settled in Auburn after the Civil War, buying property on South Street/Rt. 34 and turning it into a home for aged and indigent minorities.<span style="">  </span>She died on March 10, 1913, and remains an inspiration to people everywhere. </font></em></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">From the wooden bridge, continue down the trail. Watch the ground for an occasional root will slither across the trail, half buried in the gravel.<span style="">   </span>Stop when you get to the first railroad tie that lays across the trail its about 2 inches wide, half buried in the dirt, a relic of days gone by. 50 steps beyond this tie, youll notice some really large wooden railroad joists on the left side of the trail, moss covered, and protected by a messy-looking gopher hole. Behind these joists is Box #3.</font></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1630085236MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Goudy">You can now advance to the Dunning Avenue end of the trail, or turn around and head back.<span style="">  </span>We hope you enjoyed the boxes!
