unfortunately, there really is no way at all to get these shirts by <br/>
the gathering. I feel badly about this after having made it clear <br/>
that the price would b $11 and nothing more, but if you won't be able <br/>
to drive back and pick up your shirt once they're mailed to us in <br/>
Spetember, we really need to (gulp) ask you to pay another $3.85 for <br/>
shipping. <br/>
<br/>
I'm reeally sorry about this, but we just can't afford to mail out <br/>
all the shirts at $3.85 a pop. It's only 10 cents less to do regular <br/>
first class instead of priority, but we're guaranteed delivery with <br/>
the priority envelopes, so there it is. So, if you won't be able to <br/>
pick up, please bring an extra $3.85 with you to the gathering to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we can hang on to your shirts FOREVER if you want, since you'll <br/>
have already bought them, so if you want to wait until we see you at <br/>
the Canadian gathering on Memorial Day weekend to avoid the shipping <br/>
fee, that's cool, too! I will bring shirts to any gathering I know <br/>
you'll be at with us, so don't give up hope on staying within your <br/>
shirt budget just yet! Contact us and we'll let you know where we're <br/>
gonna be next (if we end up having the night boxing event in October, <br/>
that'll be another chance to pick up).<br/>
<br/>
Here's the list of shirts and sizes I have so far (S, M, L, XL and <br/>
XXL)...let me know if you're missing from the list.<br/>
<br/>
RocNRon (M)<br/>
Dusty Strings (M)<br/>
Craftymouse (M) Paid<br/>
Dandelion (XL) Paid<br/>
Dagonell (XL) Paid<br/>
Norasta (L) Paid<br/>
Guitarzan (XL) Paid<br/>
Silver Dragon Quinn (XL)<br/>
Celtic Quinn (XL)<br/>
Green Star Quinn (XL)<br/>
Dutchess Quinn (XXL)<br/>
DebBee (L)<br/>
WINK (XL) Paid<br/>
Tarheel (L) Paid<br/>
Tirolbill (L) Paid<br/>
Songchick (M, L, XXL)<br/>
BabyPink Bag Piper (S, S, M)<br/>
Talking Turtle (L)<br/>
Missmoon (XXL)<br/>
Jiggs (XXL)<br/>
Ninja Rob (XL)<br/>
Lock Wench (L, L)<br/>
Tamsyn (S, L)<br/>
Catbead (XL)<br/>
MtNestRobin (L)<br/>
Moonlightgamer (XXL) Paid<br/>
And Sprite &amp; Highlander (XL, XXL) Paid<br/>
<br/>
Most of you still need to pay, so if you want to mail out the money, <br/>
you'll need to do in by Monday or Tuesday at the latest to get it <br/>
here on time. Otherwise, just wait until the gathering. Did I miss <br/>
anyone???<br/>

Hopefully you won't have a trunkfull of T shirts as the border guys<br/>
may think you are coming up here to set up business!  Not likely, but<br/>
you never know.  I am getting really ginned about the May gathering<br/>
here in Kingston.  Jumping the couch in fact!<br/>
Have a blast next weekend, sorry we can't be there with you guys.</div>
