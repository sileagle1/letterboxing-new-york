We tend to idolize those who actually spent some time here, hence the worshipping of the Baldwin brothers. Their mother lives here and they visit often, going to church and the grocery stores and doing a lot of charity events. They are friendly and fun and give a lot back to this community. :)<br/><br/>LW<br/><br/><b><i>norastaa &lt;windytrail2000@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1498015819replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1498015819ygrp-text"> <div>Wow, I didn't know Tom Cruise was born in Syracuse!

I DID make a stamp for Auburn's famous Lady, Harriet Tubman.  I
had it as a Bonus Box for my Historic Auburn Series for a long time.
Then it went missing. I happened to show it to a friend of mine later
who was like, "Dang Jen, she looks like she's in black-face!" Holy
cow!! That's what you get when you're not used to drawing and carving
out people. I didn't MEAN it to look like that. I hope I didn't offend
anyone!  :oX<br/>
