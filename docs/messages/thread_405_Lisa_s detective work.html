I figured you weren't being mobbed by a bluebird.  They are sweet<br/>
little birdies.  Jays are cheeky brats, and I love them both, with<br/>
different parts of my heart.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I saw my first Eastern Blue Bird, I was driving to do<br/>
some decorative painting work in a very posh suburb of DC, and I<br/>
almost drove my car off the road, because I couldn't believe what I<br/>
was seeing.  I was so excited, that I was babbling to all the other<br/>
contractors on the job, who all seemd really unimpressed.  I<br/>
enventually figured out that they thought I had seen a Blue Jay, which<br/>
is nice, but no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
New York state has done a great job in bringing back the Eastern Blue<br/>
Bird.  These birds nest in holes in trees, and are very social.  So<br/>
you'll see a lot of yellow (why??) houses in pairs in fields all over<br/>
rural New York.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm such a big softy (and I'm often a little sleep deprived during my<br/>
summmers at the Opera) that I almost burst into tears at one Fourth of<br/>
July parade, where the Cub Scout had a float about the three hundred<br/>
bird boxes they had created.  They built a giant bird box, and dressed<br/>
someone's little sister as a bluebird, who was holding a sign saying<br/>
"thank you for all our houses."  People who see my bad ole post-punk<br/>
self are often amused that I'm such a nature lover....<br/>

PS -- Three hundred (bird) boxes? Sounds like a job for Lock Wench!</div>
