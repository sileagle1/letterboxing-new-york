I summered in the town of Ohio as a child so this got my curiousity going.  We used to fish in an<br/>

was ten so don't remember if there were any potholes but in doing some research found the above<br/>

I found there are probably more of these potholes along the canada but probably not accessable. <br/>

I tried both of my long distance friends (NYC &amp; Key West) to see if <br/>
they remember how to get to the Potholes on West Canada Creek. We're <br/>
all getting up there in years (over 50) and memory is foggy, even <br/>
though we fondly remember going there to swim in warm pothole water on <br/>
occasion.<br/>
<br/>
MY SUGGESTION: get a USGS Geologic survey map of the area, and look <br/>
for a dam, a power plant, and plunging ravine topography. The maps <br/>
will include roads -- even farm roads. There's also a bridge nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the new online satellite photo/maps would work. <br/>

We want to go to Moss Island when I visit last week of this month. <br/>
Would someone please post directions?<br/>

in Earth Science &amp; geology in high school in Utica, no teacher ever <br/>
explained it that well. All we got was "the Mohawk Valley was a big trough <br/>
from melting glaciers".<br/>
<br/>
I do think I located where we went by using the USGS Terraserver &amp; online <br/>
topographical maps. I saw the words "Karst Bridge", and remember that karst <br/>
means a glacially eroded landscape (i.e. potholes).<br/>
It sort of just below Hinkley, I believe and to the east of Poland.<br/>
<br/>
3 map images attached, zooming in on where we went swimming.<br/>
Thanks for the info!<br/>
