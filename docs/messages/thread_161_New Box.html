<p>I thought I would share my experience with other new boxers. It's my cautionary tale! lol </p>
<p>I planted a box that required you to untie a long string and lower the box to stamp in..then raise the box back up and tie it off again. However, I did not state this in the instructions. I wanted boxers to be surprised when they discovered it and I thought it was self explanatory how to get the box down. I used very hideable string ( wax coated hemp) and tested it several times myself with no problems. The string was well hidden and the box was undetectable as well.</p>
<p>Well, never take anything for granted. Judging by the notes from those who stamped in as well as reports I got from people who emailed me recently.. I needed to check the box. I now  know I needed to leave specific instructions on how to remove and replace the box.</p>
<p>Some people tried to throw the box back up over the branch, some tried to tie longer pieces of rope which were NOT hideable but at least they could get it back up there. All of these things were done with the best of intentions and my best guess is that the long original string somehow got broken and boxers did their best to preserve the hiding spot. Alas, it was not enough as the box was discovered and stolen. At least they left the stamp and the logbook!!</p>
<p>I now will switch to tougher, hideable string ( such as fishing line) and I will replace the box nearby with instructions. Thank you so much for those of you who tried to fix the broken string  and rehide the box! I appreciate everything you tried to do. For a short time, this box will be retired but will be readded and rehidden shortly. Thanks again!</p>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1313130882">It's tricky to find, but there's a similar spot just outside of Herkimer, on <br/>
the West Canada Creek. It also has huge room-sized potholes that in the <br/>
summer are perfect for swimming in. All I remember is turning off the road <br/>
before Herkimer, up a farm road, that took a turn, backtracked a bit, and we <br/>
parked. It's not officially a spot for tourists.<br/>
<br/>
We (my family) talked about maybe doing a "Herkimer diamond" box.<br/>

I just e-mailed my nieces, and asked that we put Moss Island on our agenda <br/>
for July.<br/>

Trexlertown yesterday (allentown Pa) and knowing we were at the right spot it still took us about<br/>

Better hunting next time. <br/>

7th Lake? In the Adirondacks? Ah man, I searched for that box for like an hour over Fourth of July<br/>
weekend and couldn't find it for the life of me, LOL! Glad to hear it's still there... and hmmm...<br/>
maybe I will have to search for it again if I go up to see the leaves change. :o) </span></blockquote></div>
