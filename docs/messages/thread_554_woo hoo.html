                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-218312307">Go New York!!!  Three boxes posted today.  I've been seeing that happen a great deal <br/>
recently.  Congrats to all who are out there planting and making NY an even better state to <br/>
box in.  I guess we all owe Lock Wench a big thanks for inspiring more of us to carve and <br/>
plant.  The Crew out in Schenectady are doing a great job as well as a big shout ou to Scout <br/>
for hitting up the Southern Tier.  I hear Crafftymouse has a few more out towards OZ, and the <br/>
Bufallo area keeps making steady gains. Sorry if you've been planting and I haven't named <br/>
you, ther'es just been too many boxes going out to keep track of all of them.   I'm trying to <br/>
hit a the Fingefr Lakes region a bit more.  I've got an upcoming series in Penn Yan, then I'm <br/>
gona have to head further afield since this area is pretty well saturated for abou a 25 mile <br/>
radius.  If anyone has any ideas or wants to go on a planting mission let me know.  I'll <br/>
clumsily carve what I can.  Keep up the great work to all who are out there, and if your not <br/>
carving and planting give it a try.  I still have all 10 fingers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing in NY <br/>

be forgotten either!  The Capital District of NY (Albany/Schenectady/Saratoga/Rensselaer <br/>
counties) is definitely getting extremely active and filled with all kinds of wonderful boxes, <br/>
not to mention the counties just south and west. Now I don't have to travel when I want to <br/>
box -- I haven't been able to keep up with all the activity here. (But we will be doing some <br/>
boxing in the Buffalo area next month...)<br/>
<br/>
Go NY! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, thank you to MTnestRobin for hosting the small but wonderfully relaxing gathering to <br/>
meet Paul from SF yesterday at her camp.  It was fun meeting everyone, and getting better <br/>
acquainted with Robin, Knitica, and Fireball.<br/>
