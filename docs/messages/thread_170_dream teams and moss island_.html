                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-735096932">Whoo hoo!  I had a great weekend.  I did the "Moss Island" hike, which <br/>
was a blast!!!!  Thank you Lock Wench for pointing us to this amazing <br/>
spot.  I dragged along two non-letterboxing friends and I think they <br/>
are hooked.<br/>
<br/>
I also found "Dream Teams" boxes in Cooperstown.  I'm so impressed <br/>
that the Girl Guides actually found anywhere to hide boxes in the <br/>
hyper-manicured village of Cooperstown.<br/>
<br/>
Now all I have to do is locate Paul in SF's secret swimming hole <br/>
spot.....<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I've planted five boxes in the Cooperstown area.  Look <br/>
for "Healing Waters" in Sharon Springs, and "Nature at the Opera" in <br/>
Cooperstown.  I had some trouble posting, so they're not listed with <br/>
both AQ and LBNA at the moment.  You can find both of them on AQ for <br/>
the time being.<br/>

<div>So glad you had a good time at Moss Island, one of my favorite places.  Did you take the Little Falls Thruway exit? My dad calls it the "Maytag" exit as it is the least used thruway exit in the whole NY system...lol.  The workers there always look startled when a car comes through!<br/></div>
<div>So excited to hear you planted boxes in Cooperstown!  I think I will have to drag my baseball author brother-in-law down to find your boxes. And Sharon Springs is another excellent place. Such a fascinating spot. I'm looking forward to finding those as well. Nice job!</div>
