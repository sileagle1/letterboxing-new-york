Nature Center series yesterday and couldn't believe our eyes when we <br/>
reached the Heron Rookery! Hundreds of birds and too many nests to <br/>
count! It was like something out of prehistoric times. If you haven't <br/>
done this series yet, or you have and would like to see the rookery <br/>
when it's full, go now! We were able to sit for a good 45 minutes <br/>
watching the birds completely uninterrupted. Just amazing!<br/>
<br/>
We also replanted the Dark Materials series at Rice Creek yesterday. <br/>
More to come soon!<br/>
<br/>
I'll scurry back to my hole-in-the-wall now...squeak,<br/>
