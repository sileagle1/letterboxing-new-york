Subject: [LbCNY] An Intro<br/>

&gt;   Just wanted to jump on here and give a quick intro. We started <br/>
&gt; letterboxing in May of this year and have had such fun looking for <br/>
&gt; boxes. I think we've attempted and not found almost as many boxes as <br/>
&gt; we have found. We did the Oriskany boxes and the drillmaster box on <br/>
&gt; our last visit to the area. We didn't see the nettles box but are <br/>
&gt; hoping to return for a visit in Nov. so if it's possible we'll hunt <br/>
&gt; then. I'm originally from Rome and now live in Indiana where my <br/>
&gt; husband is from. We try to return to CNY a few times a year so my <br/>
&gt; parents can see the kids. We took my parents with us to find the 3rd <br/>
