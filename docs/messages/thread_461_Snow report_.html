Blizzard??? What Blizzard?? Actually, though, I just now got off the
phone with my daughter and her family in Chatham NJ, and they
definitely have snow. They have at least one foot now, and more on the
way. It seems we in LbWNY land have managed to avoid it again and
hopefully for at least one more week. I'll be heading east to the Dance
Flurry in Saratoga Springs next Friday through Sunday, and I'd rather
it not snow until I get back home.<br/>

<div>We've got ourselves what looks like an old fashioned blizzard going down here in Gotham. I got back in the house yesterday just as it was starting and it's supposed to snow the rest of today I believe. I love snow. Don't have to shovel it, don't have to drive in it. If it stops in time today I'll go out and slog through it for a while. I love it! Great exercise too. It's too windy and nasty out there now.  I live up here in the far northwest Bronx, just south of Yonkers, in an area called Riverdale. It's all residential here so it's nice. Manhattan turns to slush really fast. I'm inside listening to NPR with the cats. Yes, they listen too. &lt;G&gt;</div>

It's snowing pretty good right now, though and supposed to get <br/>

that just seemed kinda complicated, so Kevin thinks we should just <br/>
spoon inside with no PJs tonight! ;-)<br/>
