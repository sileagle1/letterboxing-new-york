                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1503029351">I tried both of my long distance friends (NYC &amp; Key West) to see if <br/>
they remember how to get to the Potholes on West Canada Creek. We're <br/>
all getting up there in years (over 50) and memory is foggy, even <br/>
though we fondly remember going there to swim in warm pothole water on <br/>
occasion.<br/>
<br/>
MY SUGGESTION: get a USGS Geologic survey map of the area, and look <br/>
for a dam, a power plant, and plunging ravine topography. The maps <br/>
will include roads -- even farm roads. There's also a bridge nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the new online satellite photo/maps would work. <br/>
<br/>
We want to go to Moss Island when I visit last week of this month. <br/>
Would someone please post directions?<br/>

<div>Did you know I started a series based on searching for your childhood swimming hole? It's the Great Swimming Hole Caper and I planted the first one in Trenton Falls. LisaScenic and I are also on the look for swimming holes near Elizabethtown..which is a HOTBED for great swimming since the watershed is there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My Moss Island letterbox has directions on the page to get you there...but here they are in a nutshell.... I hope you enjoy looking for the box. Let me know!         Lock Wench</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions: <br/><br/>I-90 Thruway to Exit 29A onto RT 169 North. Go about 3 miles and turn left just before the Theodore S. Wind Bridge that crosses the Mohawk River into Little Falls. Park in the lots to the left. <br/></strong><br/><br/><b><i>Paul &lt;pgonyea@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>
