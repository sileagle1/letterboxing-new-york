<br/>
Making the semi-annual pilgramage to Western New York this coming <br/>
weekend.  Five days over the Memorial Day holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I won't have too much time for letterboxing this <br/>
trip, as I am bringing my GF back for the first time.  I'll end up <br/>
playing the tourist host mostly.<br/>
<br/>
That's OK, of course, as I have many of the boxes already that are <br/>
in the Rochester area ... oh wait, you mean there 4,568 new ones?  <br/>
Ah, yes, I see that ... GEEZ, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BUSY!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess I won't clear Ontario and Monroe counties this time <br/>
either.  Matter-of-fact, I'm not even going to get close.  I mean <br/>
there's 48 boxes in the Just Playin' Around WNY series alone!  <br/>
(Speaking of which, the clues his boxes with designated an * will be <br/>
pulled by October 2005, but no boxes in the clues are designated <br/>
with an * -- are they all there?)<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to plant another box in the area so that my "You Press <br/>
the Button, We Do the Rest" box wasn't alone, but I never got one <br/>
prepared.  Next time!<br/>
<br/>
AND ... if anyone wants to meet for a quick exchange, let me know.  <br/>
I'll have my cell phone with me ... feel free to call.  Send me an e-<br/>
mail message today and I'll send you back my cell phone number (I'll <br/>
check e-mails when I arrive there tonight).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And stop planting letterboxes!!!  At least until I can catch up ...<br/>
<br/>
LOL.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the heads up.  I probably won't go after the Just Playin' <br/>
series as they are in Medina and I don't have any plans to go near <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I will go after Jazzed on Java though.  I tried to get it last <br/>
December when I was here, but the shop was closed.  Hopefully today, <br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
