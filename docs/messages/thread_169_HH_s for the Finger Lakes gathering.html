                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-133609529">Quick question about bringing hitch hikers to the gathering this <br/>
weekend.  OK, actually two questions.<br/>
<br/>
Are we able to bring HH's to the gathering for exchanging?  I'd like <br/>
to create a couple and bring them with us if that's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Second, if we are able to bring HH's, I have a HH series called <br/>
the "Stampcatchers" ... they're by state, and go around "catching" <br/>
stamps in their respective state.  So far, I have stampcatchers for <br/>
NY, Maine, Massachussets, Connecticut, and Texas (although that one <br/>
hasn't been sent out yet)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is coming from out of state (except the ones I listed <br/>
above), and wouldn't mind taking a stampcatcher back with them to <br/>
plant in a letterbox somewhere, could you e-mail me off line and let <br/>
me know what state you're from so I can put the HH together?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and see you Saturday!<br/>
