<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">Hi There!</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">With the rapid rate of development in the northeast, each
year many miles of trails are lost.  Along with the loss of outdoor
recreation also is the loss of acres of trees and wildlife habitat. 
Organizations like the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference and the Open Space
Institute work very hard to create new outdoor spaces and campaigns to increase
community awareness.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">On Saturday 3 October 2009, my friend Elizabeth (of Rabbit’s
Friends and Relations) and I will be participating in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual
People for Trails Hike-a-thon at Bear Mountain State Park.  Funds raised
will help with trail maintenance and the creation of a new Trails for People
interpretive exhibit at the Harriman-Bear Mountain State Park.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">We were going to go for the strenuous hike of 9 miles, but
remembered back to last June when we hiked 5 miles in preparation for the
Summer is HERE! Gather and realized we weren’t twenty-something anymore
and opted for the moderate  4 mile hike.  We would like to suggest a
$5 per mile pledge.  My personal goal for this year’s Hike-a-thon is
$500.  Anything you can do (big or small) to help me reach that goal is
greatly appreciated.  If your place of business would like to sponsor us,
let me know!  Keep your pledge receipts as your donation is tax
deductible.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">Please visit my pledge page!  <a href="http://nynjtc.dojiggy.com/theboxers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nynjtc.dojiggy.com/theboxers</a>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1469496424MsoNormal">Starting today, I’ll have a pledge PT with me at all
times… make a pledge and no matter where we meet, on or off the trail
it’s yours! And of course a box or two will be planted along the way!</p>
