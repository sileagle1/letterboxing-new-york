Yes, my dearest 'mouse, those are "magical" words in our home.  <br/>
Mmmmmmmm  Beeeeeeeeeeeeer.  PB, would love to hang, but will be in <br/>
Annapolis MD  (with Koyote, Poison Ivy, Bulldawg, PWalker and <br/>
Classic Joe).  From there we are headed to Newport RI to get in some <br/>
boxing &amp; golf, and finally off to the Cape for a couple of weeks <br/>
with ALL the Capers and their numerous boxes.  We'll be back in Mid-<br/>
July sometime.  My Dad, a boxer, will be staying at our place, and <br/>
loves beer and boxing.  I'll contact him if you are all interested <br/>
in an exchange with him.  GO Sox will be replanted when I get back, <br/>
but unfort, not until :(  I, too, sugest you visit Rice Creek.  <br/>
Great trails with even better boxes.  C'mouse is as talented as they <br/>
come (even though she is VERY modest about her ability, I'll yell it <br/>
out!!!), and Yankeechik too has a box or two there.  She also is <br/>
very creative.  Rice creek is VERY VERY VERY worth the trip to <br/>
Oswego alone (not even including the many others around.  Well, my <br/>
friends, I need to go and pack more :)<br/>
