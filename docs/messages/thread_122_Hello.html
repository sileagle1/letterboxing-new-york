<br/>
I am a native CNY'er, living in Auburn. A friend turned me on to <br/>
letterboxing and my greyhounds and I are having a wonderful time with <br/>
it! Part art, part scavenger hunt, part nature walk, part dog walk... <br/>
perfect! :o) <br/>
<br/>
I hope it's okay to ask some questions. I carved my personal stamp <br/>
last month, and actually went letterboxing with my friend (who got me <br/>
into letterboxing, "Kit Kat") this weekend at Clark Reservation in <br/>
Jamesville. We found Little Gem, A Good Day for a Dog Walk and some <br/>
of the Cave Series. I had such a fab time! (In fact, as soon as I got <br/>
home, I started carving my own stamp series to hide, LOL!). <br/>
<br/>
I guess my question is this. When I exchanged my stamp, it seemed <br/>
that everyone else wrote their name and date next to their stamp. <br/>
Lots of nicknames (I see many here, too!). I didn't have anything so <br/>
I wrote "Jen Z with Lucy and Clifford" (me and my greyhounds, LOL).  <br/>
Is it appropriate to use my, and my dog's, real names? Everyone has <br/>
kind of <br/>
nicknames. Should I make one up? Is it too late since I already <br/>
started letterboxing? How do you pick a nickname out?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, found this site on Catbead Mischief's link page and am very <br/>
excited. Especially now that spring is here and we can finally get <br/>
into letterboxing, LOL! :o)<br/>
