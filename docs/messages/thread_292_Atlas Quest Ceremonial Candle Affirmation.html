<br/>
Well, after this post on the Premium Board at AQ, it was apparent <br/>
that we needed to put our candles where our mouths were! So, after <br/>
getting candles and our Springchick from AQ headquarters, we did Ryan <br/>
one stupider and draped ourselves in the ceremonial robes to proceed <br/>
with our Affirmation Ceremony. <br/>
<br/>
We lit the appropriate number of candles (5), knelt at the AQ shrine <br/>
(okay, sat at the picnic table with it) and spoke aloud the <br/>
affirmation, thereby invoking the true spirit of letterboxing. We <br/>
also read from the Book of Speedball, verses 2004-2005 and sacrificed <br/>
a huge horsefly that landed on Moonlightgamer's back while we were <br/>
stamping. At the end, most of us signed into the event book with the <br/>
official AQ pencils, too. There was even a little bloodshed as both <br/>
Celtic Quinn and Moonlightgamer were both stung by yellowjackets <br/>
trying to get the "What A Boy Wants" LB out of the tree (which they <br/>
successfully did, I might add!)...oh, and when I reached into my <br/>
backpa...er, ceremonial bag of holding for the pencils and stabbed <br/>
myself with 5 of them. I think we must have done it wrong, though, <br/>
since we STILL don't have a clue! (we did kinda wait until AFTER noon <br/>
to light the candles...darn it!) :-)<br/>
<br/>
Even though this was a sacred gathering, it WAS an official event <br/>
with its own event stamp and flash photography was allowed. Celtic <br/>
Quinn should be posting the pics from this once they get home from <br/>
boxing and upload them to the photo album here and on AQ. I'll post <br/>
part of the Book of Speedball in the event description as well for <br/>
folks to laugh at (in reverance, of course!). All in all, a hilarious <br/>
day at Rotary Park, but a very weird one for the folks that lived <br/>
nearby and saw us in our ceremonial robes and hats (which were NOT <br/>
just sheets from the closet, the hat from an old Halloween costume <br/>
and a pillow on my head, no matter WHAT the investigating officer <br/>
says!). <br/>

irreverent humor in this!<br/>
