replace and two more boxes that need some love and attention.  I have<br/>
to thank Catbead for all her great planting instruction. There are<br/>
STILL some Catbead boxes that I have yet to find, but I won't give up!  <br/>
<br/>
I am most distraught about the loss of the I LOVE NY Hitchhiker<br/>
Hostel. I still think the crossroads area is the best and most<br/>
convenient location for travelers but I am testing a new hiding place<br/>
before I plant another Hostel. I have a "dummy" hostel in place<br/>
(hidden a couple of weeks ago) and I will be checking it next week to<br/>
see if the hiding spot works. If it has remained untouched, I will be<br/>
planting the newly carved HHH stamp and a new container. I will test<br/>
it with my own HH's first and if it all works, I will call for new<br/>
additions. I'd like to get it up and running before the wealth of New<br/>
England/Mid- Atlantic gathers begin.<br/>
<br/>
Still waiting to hear back from a friends in the state park system and<br/>
then I will publish my findings. The only park I did not directly ask<br/>
about letterboxes was at Clark Reservation. There are too many boxes<br/>
there from various letterboxers for me to even THINK about speaking<br/>
for all. I don't want to jeopardize anyone else's boxes.<br/>
Now that summer is about over, I look forward to FINDING boxes. I<br/>
plant and maintain in the summer, but fall is my favorite season to<br/>
hunt for boxes. So maybe I will see some of you out on the trails! <br/>
