amount this weekend with much lower temperatures next week..so we <br/>
should be in good shape for Desperately Seeking Sun. I am awaiting <br/>
the last two letterboxes...one from Esmerelda and one from <br/>
LisaScenic. I've received boxes from the following carvers, in no <br/>
special order...<br/>
<br/>
Archimedes Screw<br/>
phynstar<br/>
BullDawg<br/>
y-nought<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
Acorn<br/>
SpudHund<br/>
Trailhoundz<br/>
Paul in SF<br/>
Scarab of the Doubtful Guests<br/>
<br/>
The last two are on their way...meaning we have a dozen carvers from <br/>
all over the United States who will be represented at this event! I <br/>
am so crazy excited about all this that I think I will exhaust myself <br/>
before I even get there. lol  But everything is cranking right along, <br/>
so we should be in for a really good time. <br/>
<br/>
Last minute additions are always welcome. Our reserved room is <br/>
supposed to fit 50 people for dining, but I am sure we can squeeze <br/>
more in for this event. Even the people working there are starting to <br/>
get revved up for this! Hope you can make it!<br/>
