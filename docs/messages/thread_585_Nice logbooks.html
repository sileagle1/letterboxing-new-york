logbook) also makes a three pack of smaller blank books in the same <br/>
pocket size.  I thought these would make great logbooks to plant in <br/>
boxes-blank pages, nice thick paper, and they could be cut in half for <br/>
smaller boxes.  They seem a little harder to find than the rest of the <br/>
moleskin line, but they are sold at both Borders and Waldenbooks, the <br/>
two of which now share a no charge rewards card that looks like a <br/>
pretty nice deal.  I think it was a little under $6 for the three <br/>
pack, so maybe a little pricy, but a really nice journal to save from <br/>
your box, and much more cost effective if you do cut in half.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I saw them a while ago but my friend couldn't remember for <br/>
sure where he bought them, so now that I found them I thought I'd pass <br/>
on the good info.  I have a heck of a time finding decent blank <br/>
books.  For some of my smaller boxes I've just been making them.<br/>
