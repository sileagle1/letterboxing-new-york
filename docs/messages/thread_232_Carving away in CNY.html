                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-406595419">Let's see... I've been in CNY a little over 24 hours, and have carved <br/>
a large hinged stamp for a new box soon to be planted <br/>
called, "Fifteen Years". You'll have to answer a number of questions <br/>
correctly in order to locate the box.<br/>
<br/>
I've also prepared replacements for the missing "Trip, Trap" box and <br/>
the missing Oriskany namesake mini-box. I also carved a really nice <br/>
stamp that I'm sending down to my friend in Key West to plant. I may <br/>
re-carve Drillmaster, too, time allowing. I went to find "The Place <br/>
of the Nettles" (my niece's and friends box). We're organizing a <br/>
family letterboxing extravaganza outing this week to Moss Island, <br/>
Trenton Falls, the Herkimer Home, and some swimming holes [GRIN]. <br/>
There's also talk of getting out to Green Lakes to see how many of <br/>
catbead's boxes we can find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to have "Fifteen Years" in place during the week, so <br/>
that anyone coming in for my get-together on Saturday can swoop in on <br/>
it if desired. It'll be about 3 miles away from here.<br/>
<br/>
When not carving, I've been in the swimming pool. Thanks for having <br/>
the super-heat turned down before I arrived. That was very <br/>
thoughtful -- and I'm happy to report that I haven't gotten a <br/>
mosquito bite yet!<br/>

We were looking at ALL the many boxes you've planted &amp; trying to figure <br/>
out which ones were within easy striking distance... what might be your <br/>
recommendations?</div>
