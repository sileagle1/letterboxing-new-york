                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-79448697">Well if my boxes are any indication it has been a SLOW summer only 5 reported finds.  I can't <br/>
say much gas prices and general life have kept me fairly out of the game as well.  So what to <br/>
do?????  I am thinking that next weekend 8/17 -8/19 is free for me so I think I might take <br/>
myself out camping in the Finger Lakes Nat. forest.  I'll know more for sure the early part of <br/>
next week.  If I am I will be at the leanto near Outback in LB that I planted.  I will have the <br/>
appropriate PT's with me and maybe something new to boot.  It sounds like a plug for my <br/>
boxes but it isn't meant to be.  Might even call it a mini gather who knows.  Stay tuned on <br/>
AQ.<br/>
