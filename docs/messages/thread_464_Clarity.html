                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1194046686">*sigh* Here I go again. I originally SUGGESTED we think about merging <br/>
WNY and CNY to into a bigger LBNY as I thought it would be more <br/>
inclusive and we could make the state of NY a boxing mecca as much as <br/>
Connecticut has made their's. After all, we have the biggest <br/>
wilderness east of the Mississippi as well as wonderful lakes and one <br/>
of the biggest and grandest cities in the WORLD. Heck, we even have a <br/>
thousand islands!! :) Fat chance we'll be tripping over boxes anytime <br/>
soon in THIS state.<br/>
<br/>
I DO foresee a time when this hobby gets SO big, that it will <br/>
splinter into many different groups..just like LBNA became regions, <br/>
and regions have become states. I just didn't think we were to that <br/>
point. You can drive anywhere in the state in under 6 hours and we <br/>
have less than 100 members in ALL of LBNY...even less in the old CNY <br/>
and WNY. AQ has state boards, without even regional ones and it seems <br/>
to work just fine. I don't see anyone clamoring to Ryan that we <br/>
divide the states up..or even group the states together to have <br/>
regions. At least, not yet.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to reiterate that mine was a SUGGESTION only. After that <br/>
it went out of my hands and was switched overnight. A painful change, <br/>
but there was less bitching after it than anyone thought. Only a <br/>
handful of people complained...including me because members were <br/>
never allowed to vote on it.<br/>
<br/>
But what I really enjoy is boxing, boxing, boxing and more boxing. :)<br/>

it is intended.  Truly.  We (I) have heard most of what has been <br/>
said, and.....well.....OK. *shrug*  You keep saying the same thing <br/>
over and over, like it changes something.  We know.  No disrespect, <br/>
but We ARE to the point where we need to "splinter" for personal <br/>
IDs.  We still are all proud NYers, but we also need to be <br/>
individuals or regionites.  It shouldn't matter to ANYONE who does <br/>
what, and I'm not saying you do or ANYONE else does!!!! I totally <br/>
understand what it is that you are saying, and I understand what it <br/>
is/was that you were/are trying to accomplish, but........*shrug*<br/>
<br/>
LbOZ will be up ASAP.  I can't wait to promote the great county of <br/>
Oswego, NY :) :)  and all its letterboxes and people.  Ladybug, <br/>
Craftymouse, Catbead, Lock Wench, Myself.....(I know that I am <br/>
forgetting others) all have letterboxes up here.  Come on up (or <br/>
Down)!!!  Enjoy this region of CNY.  It's worth the trip.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1843209927">In Lock Wench's defense, I should definitely mention that I was the <br/>
one who closed up the WNY boards, not her. After I asked about <br/>
changing the LBWNY logo to reflect all of NY last summer, she <br/>
mentioned that she and the LBCNY group had met that summer to talk <br/>
about how to include more people in the CNY group. After she made the <br/>
suggestion about being one unified state, quite a few people said <br/>
that they felt having one board would be easier. That led me to <br/>
believe that we in WNY might really have been quietly offending <br/>
others by starting our own group, so I wanted to remedy that and <br/>
QUICK ('cause Lord KNOWS I didn't want to make boxing enemies at ANY <br/>
time!)<br/>
<br/>
What I didn't take into account was two things: One, I should have <br/>
realized that the opinions of those in CNY about WNY's group weren't <br/>
nearly as important as those in WNY itself. I know some people in CNY <br/>
feel like they should have had the chance to vote as to whether or <br/>
not to keep WNY, but since we weren't a single group back then, that <br/>
wouldn't really have made sense (like New Yorkers voting to keep Ohio <br/>
or something!). What should have actually happened was each group <br/>
should have voted on whether or not to merge with the other in the <br/>
privacy of their own talk boards. Then if both groups agreed, we <br/>
should have closed both CNY and WNY, then started a brand new group <br/>
with the same owners and moderators of both groups to call LBNY. That <br/>
way, it would have been more of a merge instead of an annexing of one <br/>
group or the other.<br/>
<br/>
I really do feel badly about closing the group without thinking this <br/>
through, but to tell you the truth, I really felt under pressure to <br/>
do this when it seemed that a lot of people agreed with Lock Wench's <br/>
suggestion (for various reasons, all good ones to boot). Plus, the <br/>
idea that CNY folks might come to hate WNY folks over our little <br/>
glorified e-mail list was just too much to shoulder. I certainly <br/>
didn't want to offend anyone, but in trying to please all, I forgot <br/>
to take into account the second thing, which is the fact that what's <br/>
said on the boards isn't always general consensus. Some folks don't <br/>
have the time or mental energy to waste on standing up for what they <br/>
want on the boards (heck, I know I get worn out and shaky writing <br/>
these long posts)!, so contrary to popular belief, there was a LOT of <br/>
bitching about it that went on later, just not on the boards. People <br/>
came up to me at gatherings or sent me personal e-mail to say they <br/>
felt bad that I had closed WNY and wished they'd been there to <br/>
provide a second opinion or viewpoint. I think the only person who <br/>
had time to post an opposing view from WNY was ROCnRon...and then his <br/>
computer crashed!<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I ever doubted that having a statewide board would be <br/>
good, but, but as catbead said, I do miss the comraderie of the <br/>
smaller group (which essentially consisted of me and Celtic Quinn <br/>
posting goofy stuff back and forth to folks who had limited computer <br/>
access in Buffalo and Rochester!). <br/>

&gt; and regions have become states. I just didn't think we were to that <br/>
&gt; point. You can drive anywhere in the state in under 6 hours and we <br/>
&gt; have less than 100 members in ALL of LBNY...even less in the old <br/>
CNY <br/>
&gt; and WNY. AQ has state boards, without even regional ones and it <br/>
seems <br/>
&gt; to work just fine. I don't see anyone clamoring to Ryan that we <br/>
&gt; divide the states up..or even group the states together to have <br/>
&gt; regions. At least, not yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I want to reiterate that mine was a SUGGESTION only. After that <br/>
&gt; it went out of my hands and was switched overnight. A painful <br/>
change, <br/>
&gt; but there was less bitching after it than anyone thought. Only a <br/>
&gt; handful of people complained...including me because members were <br/>
&gt; never allowed to vote on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what I really enjoy is boxing, boxing, boxing and more <br/>
boxing. :)<br/>
