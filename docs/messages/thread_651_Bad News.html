Trail may have to be closed due to erosion problems.  Just last Fall I planted a series of seven <br/>
boxes along that trail.  I don't think the trail is closing today or tomorrow but if you are <br/>
intrested in these boxes you may want to find them sooner than later.  I will keep posting as I <br/>
find out more.<br/>
