Box ON! gathering, so will post it here for everyones benefit.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any specific questions, I'll be happy to address them...<br/>
<br/>
What: Box ON! letterbox gathering<br/>
Where: Victoria Park, Belleville, ON (approx 80 Mi West of the 1000 <br/>
Islands bridge)<br/>
When: 29 Sep 07 from 9:30 to 5:30<br/>
Who: all letterboxers and families/sig others welcome. Pets Ok on a <br/>
leash (Dog Park fairly nearby as well)<br/>
Cost: donations greatfully accepted<br/>
Potluck lunch. Should have a BBQ or 2 available as well<br/>
<br/>
There are currently about 75 LBs in the Kingston - Brighton <br/>
corridor. That should swell to over 100 by the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
This promises to be a more intimate (read smaller) gathering than <br/>
many we've been to in CA and NY, so there will be ample opportunity <br/>
to exchange, swap some lies and do some serious boxing.<br/>
<br/>
As seems to be becoming a bit of a tradition, there'll probably be a <br/>
pre- and post gather gathering as well (anyone remember the <br/>
Batchelor Party in Kingston??) More to follow.<br/>
<br/>
For those that would like to participate , but can't attend, we'd be <br/>
happy to place any donated boxes. The theme is Ontario, but we're <br/>
pretty flexible.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jiggs</div>
