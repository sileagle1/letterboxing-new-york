busy doing search and rescue for all the boxes damaged/lost in the <br/>
flood areas. I confirmed that "Salisbury Covered Bridge" is long <br/>
gone, as is "Empire Hotel". Rescued are "Planes, Trains, Automobiles <br/>
and Boats?" which was found and repaired by Rattlesnake. Thanks, <br/>
Grant!  I have retired it and will probably move it in the near <br/>
future as that area became QUITE flooded and will so again.<br/>
<br/>
Checked on several boxes and found all in fine shape and marked them <br/>
as such. "Furnace Brook Trail" sustained some nasty flooding but the <br/>
box is still there. Wear rubber boots. :) The good news is that the <br/>
little trickle of waterfall is now a full fledged waterfall! I <br/>
changed the clues slightly to reflect the recent flooding.<br/>
<br/>
Pogey Pond has been slightly moved ..please check the new <br/>
clues. "The Haunting", my special glow in the dark box, is back in <br/>
place after new ink was added.<br/>
<br/>
I checked on box #1 of I Never Strike the Same Place Twice, and <br/>
despite recent reports, it is safely in place. I added a few details <br/>
to the clues to make it easier to find it's hidey hole.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I will check on a few more....only about 20 left to check! <br/>
Thanks to everyone who sent comments regarding box area conditions <br/>
after the flooding...<br/>
