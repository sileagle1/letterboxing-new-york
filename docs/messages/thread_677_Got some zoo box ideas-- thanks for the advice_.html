<br/>
Thanks for the advice as to how to go about doing this.  I'm going to<br/>
be meeting with a friend later this week or early next week, and hope<br/>
to have her help me with the stamp.  I would like to make the stamp<br/>
itself a puzzle-- and cut it into pieces and you have to put them all<br/>
back together.  Hopefully it'll come out right!  And I do plan to give<br/>
clues as to where to find the stamps-- like instead of saying, "It's<br/>
next to the eagle exhibit", give clues about the animals and have<br/>
searchers go from there.<br/>
<br/>
I will let everyone here know when I post the info on AQ and LBNA. <br/>
Thanks again, and any more suggestions will be welcome!<br/>
<br/>
