rather to stimulate letterboxing in an area that needed some more <br/>
action. From the beginning, I invited anyone who letterboxed not only <br/>
in Central NY, but New York State as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
If folks decided to combine the 2 Yahoo groups, WNY &amp; CNY, and simply <br/>
make one big LbNYS, I'd still be happy. It's not about how you slice <br/>
the cake, it's about making sure everyone has some. Of course, we <br/>
haven't heard from the NYC/Long Island folks, so that might be <br/>
premature.<br/>
<br/>
In California, we have 2 groups, one for Northern CA and one for <br/>
Southern CA. The 2 groups do communicate with each other and some <br/>
folks belong to both.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever is going to work best for communicating about new boxes, <br/>
issues, events, and people is what should happen.<br/>

it seem like a separate thing. Again, the actual distance for most of <br/>
us made it seem necessary to have a place to share Western NY info. Now <br/>
that there's more of us (and more traveling back and forth), it doesn't <br/>
seem nearly as important (as long as we don't pile our events on the <br/>
same day!).<br/>
<br/>
The only downstate folks I know are Missmoon &amp; Talking Turtle (who's <br/>
got a whole group of folks that we met at Fear Faketor). I'm hoping <br/>
they'll throw in their two cents, too.<br/>
