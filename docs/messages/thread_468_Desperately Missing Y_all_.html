                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-762753363">I think it'll be about the same as having the big USA board and the <br/>
smaller state/regional boards...it'll streamline the amount of info <br/>
LBNY gets so that we're not getting local boxing news, just the stuff <br/>
that will affect the state in general. When I have something I know <br/>
is important to more than just WNY (like gatherings or such), I <br/>
always crosspost. If it's just something about boxing in Knowlesville <br/>
or Pembroke on the weekend where I know only a WNY person could get <br/>
here on short notice, I figure it's not something anyone else is <br/>
really going to miss. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Plus, with the smaller boards, I usually hit them when we're going to <br/>
visit the area (ex--we check out the Texas boards right before we <br/>
head down for Thanksgiving), so we don't miss anything. <br/>
