It you haven't signed up yet, please do! Durand Eastman Park is only an <br/>
hour and a half from both Syracuse and Buffalo, so it can't be too much <br/>
worse for anyone else in the Central NY area. Being so near a large <br/>
city makes the hotels and weekend entertainment easier to come by. <br/>
Those of you with little ones can promise them a trip to Seabreeze, the <br/>
amusement park that's about 5 minutes from the park. And, of course, <br/>
Lake Ontario is all over the place!<br/>
<br/>
If you can't come, box donations would be GREATLY appreciated! We need <br/>
someone with a a good carving tool and a steady eye to carve up some <br/>
stamps for the area to be placed out and about (heck, even a bad <br/>
carving tool and a blind eye...we ain't picky, we just like boxing!!!) <br/>
We could also use some raffle items, like stamp pads, nifty logbooks, <br/>
ink or ink markers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Contact us offlist if you'd like to help out...hope to see you (or your <br/>
boxes) there!<br/>

Seriously, we make gathering as painless as possible. You send us the <br/>
box, we plant it for you. When you come, bring food that ISN'T hotdogs <br/>
to share (we have drinks, but if you have special stuff you like, bring <br/>
that too!). We'll give you a booklet of clues for the boxes in the <br/>
park, you look up the ones that aren't in the park. The idea is to get <br/>
to box as much as possible, then sit around and talk about boxing as <br/>
much as possible. Then we raffle things off, out of towners go out to <br/>
dinner with us, then we go home (or to hotels) and box all day Sunday!<br/>
<br/>
Pretty simple, really! Have you signed up at AQ yet???<br/>
