stay overnight and do the night boxing event. Colden Lakes is actually<br/>
the closest campgrounds to Chestnut Ridge Park, but we're told we<br/>
won't all be together if we camp there and it doesn't have as much<br/>
stuff. Jellystone has more amenities, but it's further away in North<br/>
Java (plus Ranger Smith will be hassling us and who needs THAT???).<br/>
:-) There's also Spraguebrook, which is a state park further south and<br/>
is a little cheaper, but I think the Highlander and I have nixed that<br/>
because it's got distance AND amenities against it.<br/>
<br/>
So, Jellystone or Colden? Here's links to both sites...you guys be the<br/>
judge and let us know! <br/>

I'm also posting a poll so we can find out which park folks like best<br/>
and whether or not you'll be camping at all:<br/>
