Yes, Ford Motors is trying very hard to maintain some sort of balance and <br/>
reasonableness. What I don't understand is why conservative religious groups <br/>
have an issue with Ford placing advertising in gay-oriented publications. No <br/>
one's making them read, or pay for those ads. Driving a Ford doesn't make a <br/>
person gay (at least not to my knowledge). I'd guess that Jesus would let <br/>
Ford advertise in The Advocate -- because he'd be busy helping the poor and <br/>
sick instead.<br/>
<br/>
Gay men &amp; lesbians have $610 billion dollars of buying power. Any smart <br/>
corporation that wanted to be profitable and do the right thing, would <br/>
advertise in a variety of publications to reach all target audiences.<br/>
<br/>
I work for Charles Schwab &amp; Co. and for a long, long time, Schwab has <br/>
recognized that our clients come from all sorts of backgrounds and represent <br/>
the diversity of the U.S. population. Our employees are representative of <br/>
that diversity, and equality is a key part of our HR policies. We scored a <br/>
perfect 100 in the Equality Buying Guide (under 'Money Matters').<br/>
<br/>
What I see happening lately is insecurity around change itself... as society <br/>
changes and outdated modes of thinking fade away, people cling harder to <br/>
their religion so that they feel 'right' and safe. But equality isn't a <br/>
threat, and it isn't bringing about the downfall of civilization.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1892566703">I've always wondered how some of these groups even know what's <br/>
advertised in "Out" or "The Advocate."  Is it some guy's job to read <br/>
these things, or is there a lot of fumbling around to explain just <br/>
how one of the members HAPPENED to notice it by accident at the <br/>
dentist's office?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've been wanting a bumpersticker for ages that <br/>
says: "just another vegetarian, feminist, left handed knitter driving <br/>
a Ford truck,"  but I haven't seen one anywhere!  Now if I could have <br/>
a Jesus fish and a Pflag sticker next to that, that would more or <br/>
less sum it up, and strike a blow for not fitting into silly <br/>
stereotypes about left and right, too.  I've gotta go get to work <br/>
decorating the bumper of my truck (just as soon as I scrape all the <br/>
ice and snow off of it).<br/>

P.S. I'm so glad to here that your boxing friends have been pitching <br/>
in to support worthy charities with you.  Letterboxers are a <br/>
wonderfully supportive and diverse group of people, aren't they?<br/>
