PS -- Three hundred (bird) boxes? Sounds like a job for Lock Wench!"<br/>
<br/>
Nice try, Lisa...but the birds will have to take care of themselves <br/>
for awhile! I am very busy carving stamps for our upcoming February<br/>
event...Desperately Seeking Sun. My son had surgery this week<br/>
(everything went fine) and I spent the time in the waiting room <br/>
carvingaway like crazy. I must have been nervous...because I have <br/>
carved 7 stamps in the last 48 hours! lol<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, things are looking up. I will have the exact event venue<br/>
nailed down next week; after I check out 2 more places. I am trying to<br/>
get us as much "bang for the buck" as I can.....Great hiding places, a<br/>
great meeting space, easy directions, plenty of parking and extra fun<br/>
things to do. Stay tuned..<br/>
<br/>
As far as my Report from the Road, it took me a few days to recover<br/>
from my last outing. LOL. I went to the Mohawk Valley to "capture" the<br/>
stamps of two of our most talented carvers; Lisascenic and Paul in SF.<br/>
I had a wonderful time getting more of Paul's bird series...especially<br/>
since I am from that area. I knew exactly how to get to each of the <br/>
box<br/>
locations! My last of Paul's boxes was one at the Parkway in Utica and<br/>
was hidden near that imposing bronze eagle that overlooks it. I<br/>
discovered the park road was chained at that hour but as I was a local<br/>
I knew I could still reach the park area by going through the cemetary<br/>
next door and through a pedestrian gate on the top of the hill. So up <br/>
I drove...only to discover the pedestrian gate was locked/chained as<br/>
well! *sheesh* Too close to my prize, I decided to climb the fence. It<br/>
is a 6' heavy duty cast iron fence with 6" sharp spikes at the <br/>
top..but as I was wearing my brand new skateboarding sneaks <br/>
(excellent tread) I<br/>
decided to go for it. No problem on the way over...found the box and<br/>
stamped in..then headed back to the fence to get back to my car. I <br/>
madeit up the fence...and over..then as I went to jump down, my new <br/>
sneak<br/>
caught between two upright bars. I fell, but never touched the<br/>
ground..and my poor right ankle took my entire weight. There I<br/>
was..suspended from this fence. My left foot couldn't quite touch the<br/>
ground..only inches away. My right leg was bend behind and above <br/>
me..my poor ankle shrieking with pain now. I finally arched my back <br/>
as much as I could and grabbed two of the spikes behind and over my <br/>
head..and hung there..taking a bit of the weight off of the ankle <br/>
while I wriggled my foot..trying to free it from the shoe. With tears <br/>
streaming down my<br/>
face, I finally got out, pulled my sneak from the fence, and collapsed<br/>
with relief onto the front seat of my car. A couple of walkers looked<br/>
over curiously but moved on. I am sure they were wondering what the<br/>
heck I was doing on that fence!<br/>
<br/>
The ankle was much relieved now as well, and I decided to call it a<br/>
day. I drove to Ilion, picked up my dad, and we continued to Little<br/>
Falls where we attended the Annual Dinner for the Mohawk Valley<br/>
Alpiners hiking group. After a few cocktails, I couldn't feel my ankle<br/>
at all! I really enjoyed the speaker..a fellow named Bill Ingersoll<br/>
who is taking over the writing for Barbara McMartin, the godmother of<br/>
the Adirondacks who just died from breast cancer this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, by the time I got home my darn ankle was the size of a<br/>
grapefruit so no more letterboxing for me! Lisascenic's boxes will <br/>
have<br/>
to wait for another trip. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I am very gratified at seeing how busy the I Love NY<br/>
Hitchhiker Hostel has been. Be careful to mix your tracks if you visit<br/>
it this week...we've had a bit of snow!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone -<br/>
