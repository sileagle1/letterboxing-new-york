saved a bunch of money on my car insurance. :)  No, my good news is <br/>
that I checked our Moss Island boxes today and am happy to report <br/>
that both boxes are alive and well. We even had visitors from <br/>
SPAIN!!! In any case, today's journey was a scouting journey. My <br/>
sister and I drove to Stratford to pick up our annual wood kindling <br/>
order. You see, we purchase wood used for Louisville Sluggers (which <br/>
are made in nearby Dodgeville) and buy the wood that is not good <br/>
enough for bats but burns well in my fireplace. After stocking up we <br/>
visited two future sites I have chosen for boxes..then drove to <br/>
Dodgeville to check out the antique shops in the old Daniel Green <br/>
factory complex. Then off to Little Falls to check on the Moss Island <br/>
boxes. Profile Rock was busy with over 100 rock climbers today as the <br/>
fall rock climbing classes have begun. We made it into the potholes <br/>
on Moss Island and checked the boxes (rehiding them as they were both <br/>
left out on the shelf in my spot) and then went and grabbed a bite at <br/>
Anns'. <br/>
<br/>
Then we headed to my favorite store in the Little Falls Antique and <br/>
Gift Center....INKY FINGERS. I bought some new ink pads (those nice <br/>
little square ones I carry around in a Lock n Lock) and visited with <br/>
the owners. Both of them had been out to Moss Island and found the <br/>
boxes with their families..and hooked a BUNCH of people! SO cool. The <br/>
owner is so into it that she is now stocking PZ Cut in her store so <br/>
if you need some in a hurry...she's got it.  She carved her first <br/>
stamp and it came out great. I recommend you all go in and check out <br/>
her fabulous stamp and ink collections. She has the biggest selection <br/>
of unusual stamps that I have ever seen..as well as the Distressed <br/>
Inks, the Vintage Inks, the Chalk Inks..the Metallics..you name it. <br/>
<br/>
After that it was a trip to check out two more locations and then a <br/>
stop to see my dad in Ilion. We grabbed some tomato pie (yum!) on our <br/>
way back to Syracuse and quickly went out to my favorite orchard to  <br/>
pick apples (Leubner's in Camillus). Had some delicious hot apple <br/>
fritters from there for dessert and headed back home with a nice <br/>
bushel of Macouns. What a great day....<br/>

letterboxing, and we're attracting foreigners to upstate NY! How do <br/>
you say Moss Island in Spanish?<br/>
<br/>
I dare them to go after my box in Hawkinsville! And they'll never <br/>
solve the clues for "The _____, the Baker, and the Candlestickmaker", <br/>
because I'm sure they don't sell Wise potato chips in Barcelona! Ha ha <br/>
ha! <br/>
<br/>
Did you re-plant your box on Isla de los Mosses? Or was it never <br/>
really missing? It was cuddling up with a woodpecker, huh? Kinky...<br/>
