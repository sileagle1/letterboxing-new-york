Lock Wench &amp; MtNestRobin, who will share the duties of moderator, <br/>
with me as a distant back-up.<br/>
<br/>
Catbead, who has been a superb moderator for the group, has decided <br/>
to step down for health and personal reasons. Libby, thank you once <br/>
again for your wonderful work as LbCNY's moderator. We REALLY <br/>
appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
We have reason to celebrate - it's LbCNY's First Anniversary! It may <br/>
not be the biggest letterboxing group around, but it's a darn good <br/>
one! And it's grown considerably. When I planted my first boxes in <br/>
NY, I had no idea that there were others nearby ready to jump in.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulationms LbCNY members for a successful first year of <br/>
connecting with each other &amp; letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Please join me in welcoming MtNestRobin and Lock Wench as new co-<br/>
moderators!<br/>

<div>Thanks to all of you who help moderate and run this forum. I just joined it a few months ago, but always love reading the posts and hearing about the new letterboxes! And here's to hoping the weather will cool off so we can do more hunting soon! :o)</div>
