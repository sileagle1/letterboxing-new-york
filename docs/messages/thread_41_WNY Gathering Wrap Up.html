thought that with an hour-and-a-half drive, I'd be the furthest<br/>
travelled.  I wasn't even close.  Some people drove all day Friday<br/>
just to come to what I thought would be a small local event.<br/>
<br/>
One woman asked who I was.  I was wearing a cavalier hat, eyepatch and<br/>
a sword at my hip because I thought it would be more fun than a<br/>
nametag.  I invited her to guess.   Dagonell the Pirate?  I confirmed<br/>
it.  "Oh yes, we got your sit-rep earlier this week."  Which told me<br/>
who she was, because I had only sent out one sit-rep that week... to<br/>
Wanda and Pete!  Wanda logged her 6,000th find this weekend. <br/>
Appropriately enough, #6000 was titled "Where's Wanda?" :D<br/>

blog. Thanks again to all who came, saw and boxing their brains<br/>
out...good times!<br/>
