And I have taught a letterboxing course to some Girl Scouts and a lot of them have mentioned that they were going to try their hand at it out in the "real" world at Clark's Res and Green Lakes!<br/>

started LBing but it sure has been fun.  It could have been an article <br/>
in the sunday paper.  We don't have many weekends available for LB so <br/>
we try to fit them in when ever we are out and about - so it's great <br/>
that more are showing up in CNY.  If you all haven't had a chance to <br/>
search for the pookah clans boxes you really should.  They have some of <br/>
the most artistic stamps I have seen.  Very talented people that pookah <br/>
clan.  Would love to see a meeting next spring of those boxers in the <br/>
syracuse utica area.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>About 2 years ago our paper had a 2 page spread on letterboxing<br/>
complete with color photo's of local boxers with their logbooks and I<br/>
think a letterbox.  The article was sympathetic to the needs of<br/>
letterboxing, one look and I was hooked.  Unfortunatley it came out in<br/>
winter and we had to wait a few months for everything to thaw, so<br/>
every so often I'd pull the article out reread it and say to Fly Doc<br/>
"we really have to do this" and he'd nod in agreement.  Finally, the<br/>
weather was nice enough and we were off.  Luck was with us and our<br/>
first find was in one of the most beautiful locations I've had the<br/>
pleasure to visit.  Our second try was a box that had been MIA for<br/>
some time but was still listed on LbNA, in spite of that the day was a<br/>
lot of fun and I came away with some great photo's (one is on my<br/>
Puzzles page).<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>The Highlander and I seem to be in some disagreement about this. I <br/>
keep thinking I saw someone's geocaching website that mentioned it, <br/>
but he seems to think we saw it on the Discovery Channel. Just the <br/>
other day, though, we saw that someone had posted an NPR article on <br/>
letterboxing, so now NEITHER of us is sure.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we DO remember was that the day before had been a very <br/>
crummy day the day before and was working into another one when I <br/>
suggested we go see if this letterboxing thing was for real. We <br/>
finally went searching on August 29, 2004 and found our first 3 <br/>
boxes, all Elba Onions' plants and 2 of them first finders. We didn't <br/>
even have our STAMP yet, but that was enough to get us going. I <br/>
planted our first box the next day and my second a day later. Haven't <br/>
looked back since!<br/>
