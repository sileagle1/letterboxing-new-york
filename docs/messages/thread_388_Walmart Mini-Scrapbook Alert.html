                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-792572843">-Catbead, thanks for the tip on mini-scrapbooks. These work great for <br/>
hitchhikers and postals also.  I just stocked up on these yesterday.  <br/>
Here's a tip, if you carefully pry open the prongs just slightly and <br/>
remove the back &amp; front cover, you can add a few pages from another <br/>
book.  I split one to make two others with 19/20 pages.  You can then <br/>
cut new pages from cardstock and use a hole puncher for the top holes <br/>
and make a whole new book with the leftover covers and spiral. Then <br/>
push the prongs back into place. (Just be careful not to pry prongs <br/>
open too much).  <br/>
