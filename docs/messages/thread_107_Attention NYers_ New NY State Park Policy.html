material, but it strikes me that there may be some good things that<br/>
come out of it, despite things like quarter-mile separation<br/>
requirements.  Namely, if the NY state parks regulate letterboxing, at<br/>
the very least we know that what we're placing is "safe," so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
While i realize many people are already responsible about getting<br/>
permission to place boxes, i have to wonder--as a result of things<br/>
like this, will LBNA and AtlasQuest and any other websites that<br/>
aggregate box placements now start providing links to state<br/>
regulations in their FAQs (if they're not there already)?  Just<br/>
curious, and asking this with all possible protection for LB'ers in<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i definitely need to finish reading everything before i<br/>
comment any further and unintentionally insert my foot into my mouth<br/>
(if i haven't already!).<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm forwarding (with permission) something that was sent to me the other day<br/>
&gt; that may have an impact on our letterboxing way of life in the future. There<br/>
&gt; are 7 pages of discussion on the groundspeak.com forum (the first link) and<br/>
&gt; it looks like NYS is, with limitations and restriction, accepting<br/>
&gt; geocaching.  Personally I think it's only a matter of time before they look<br/>
&gt; at and regulate us.  Should we do anything, what should we do, how will we<br/>
&gt; respond? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>
&gt; catbead<br/>

&gt; Dear Libby,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I want to share with you something I read in the geocaching forum the other<br/>
&gt; day that may affect us letterboxers. I'm not a geocacher, but recently got a<br/>
&gt; GPS and want to do some benchmarking so I was wandering through their site<br/>
&gt; when I came across this thread started on Jan31and ending a few days ago.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; NY Park and Rec Survey   <br/>
&gt; <a href="http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985</a> <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is a lot to read if you have the time, but the gist is this, NY State<br/>
&gt; Parks and Recreation has implemented a new policy regarding geocaches placed<br/>
&gt; in NYS Parks. They are requiring geocachers to apply for a permit to obtain<br/>
&gt; stickers that must be placed on the cache itself. There is no charge for the<br/>
&gt; permit , however there are restrictions. I've attached the Terms &amp;<br/>
&gt; Conditions and a pdf of the Permit Application.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  This has a lot of implications for letterboxing in NY. I fear we are next!<br/>
&gt; In fact, near the end of the aforementioned  thread someone actually did<br/>
&gt; write "What about letterboxing?" but it was quietly overlooked except for a<br/>
&gt; small reference in  a reply.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I don't know if the "Powers that Matter" know about us yet, but it won't be<br/>
&gt; long before some geocacher applying for a permit says, "How come the<br/>
&gt; Letterboxers don't have to comply?" and it will be in our laps! I know you<br/>
&gt; have a lot of letterboxes in Green Lakes SP and since one of the<br/>
&gt; restrictions is no more than five caches, per park, per person  its going to<br/>
&gt; affect you personally if washes over onto us (letterboxers).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We have a window of opportunity to act, but how I'm not sure! I haven't<br/>
&gt; sorted out my own thoughts on this but time's awasting and I thought others<br/>
&gt; need to know about it!  I also thought you would have a better idea of what<br/>
&gt; to do with this information than I. With your letterbox contacts maybe you<br/>
&gt; could bounce it around for ideas first. Should we play it close to our chest<br/>
&gt; or have it go out on a list... I don't know! I trust you to have a more<br/>
&gt; rational perspective than I.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; Sorry, to be such harbinger of bad news! I felt you'd want to know.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Respectfully,<br/>
&gt; MTnestRobin<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Whoa Nellie! I just went to attach the pdf and it was whole MB size file!<br/>
&gt; Here's the link instead.  www.ligeocaching.com/cache_permit_application.pdf <br/>
&gt;  For that matter, here's the link for the Terms and Conditions too, that way<br/>
&gt; you won't have to open an attachment.<br/>
