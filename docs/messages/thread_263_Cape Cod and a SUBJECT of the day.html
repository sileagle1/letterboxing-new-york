people!  Made some exchanges and gathered 11 boxes :)  It was a fun <br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION..................<br/>
If you find a box, that you think is out of location (not where the <br/>
original placer meant for it to be), do you move it back???????</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-620704935">What I've always done is to put the box back where I<br/>
found it, cover it VERY well, and then contact the<br/>
placer to let them know the box may be out of place<br/>
but safe.  That way it's up to them to figure out if<br/>
it's not in the correct place, and move it if they<br/>
wish.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you're safe and sound!  Isn't MA great?  We went<br/>
there last year.  You didn't by any chance run into<br/>
the MA Stampcatcher HH in one of your finds, did you? <br/>
I've lost track of that one.<br/>

very nice HHHs on the Cape that host Hikers from all over (because <br/>
of the tourists). If it went to one of those............. it could <br/>
be ANYWHERE :)<br/>
