NY, for the Finger Lakes Wine Festival and some boxing on the side.<br/>
[Man, that sentence has so many commas, that you'd think a PhD wrote<br/>
it! ;-) ].<br/>
<br/>
We hit these en route to Corning and some wineries...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Turtle McQ for recommending Farm City Day and Farmer's<br/>
Market in Ithaca, NY. We then tripped to Interlaken to enter the<br/>
5th Dimension and FTF'ed it.  Clues have a minor error, but being <br/>
winos, we were able to overcome the wrong route number.<br/>
<br/>
We'd have found some Carantouan on the way back to PA, but the weather <br/>
prevented it yet again this year. "Wait 'till next year!"<br/>

which has a fractured bottom, but hopefully remains shielded)</div>
