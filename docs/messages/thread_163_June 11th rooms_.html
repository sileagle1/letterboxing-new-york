the Super 8 Ithaca is still open for the gathering. They're $109.99 a <br/>
night and they had rooms available as of 8:15pm tonight (the 30th). The <br/>
guy says there's about 33 rooms left (21 non-smoking, 11 with double <br/>
beds).<br/>
<br/>
This was the BEST hotel, folks...it was being remodeled a few months <br/>
ago and was really clean with soft beds. It's across the street from a <br/>
fancy Wegmans with one of those big walk around buffet style cafeterias <br/>
in it...plus the Barnes &amp; Nobles in the same complex has Starbucks<br/>
coffee (if you're as picky as the Highlander). If you guys HAVEN'T<br/>
gotten rooms, GO HERE!!! <br/>
