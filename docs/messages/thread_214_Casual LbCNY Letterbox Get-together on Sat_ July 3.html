invite any interested LbCNY'ers to a casual meet-greet-stamp-exchange <br/>
backyard lunch in very central NY -- the rustic village of Oriskany, <br/>
NY, between Utica and Rome. <br/>
<br/>
** TIME: 1:00PM on SATURDAY, July 30 **<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing nieces and nephews will help host. We'll provide soda, <br/>
burgers, and hot dogs, and you bring a potluck dish, like a salad or <br/>
dessert. We have a really great swimming pool for you to take a swim <br/>
in as well. Well-behaved kids are welcome -- there are kids of all <br/>
ages around.<br/>
<br/>
RSVP directly to me, so we can plan. Directions will be provided by <br/>
return e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I think there will be one or two NEW boxes nearby by that time, and if <br/>
you haven't collected the Nettles and Namesake series, here's your <br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
We'll visit, exchange stamps and ideas, and have fun. If anyone wants <br/>
a stamp carving lesson, I'll be happy to teach you. I'll even show you <br/>
how I make my large hinged, folding stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can come!<br/>
