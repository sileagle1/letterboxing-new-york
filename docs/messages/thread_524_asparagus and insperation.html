week as I was buying the first fresh asparagus of the year inspiration <br/>
struck......   New York is a great state with a rich agricultural and <br/>
rural heratage, at least upstate.  It is chock full oof great spots, <br/>
sugarbushes, farmers markets. ice cream stands, mini golf courses, <br/>
Amish stores and in the fall pumpkin patches and cider mills.  <br/>
Everybody has a favorite.  I intend to plant boxes during this season <br/>
in a few of those places to share with the LB brotherhood. I know some <br/>
of us have done boxes like this before.  I am in fact, stealing this <br/>
idea from Mark and Sue and there Sugarbush farms LB in Woodstock VT but <br/>
I challenge all NY boxers to do the some these boxes.  Two benefits,1.  <br/>
more boxes, and 2. I know where to get the best ice cream after my next <br/>
outing<br/>

in SF's advice and started carrying a small notebook to jot down ideas. <br/>
Almost all of my boxes are carved for a specific area but just how many <br/>
leaves, trees, waterfalls, etc can you carve? I have an entire <br/>
Adirondacks series ready to plant that are all animals found in the <br/>
Adirondacks..so I feel like I am breaking out of my shell a little. I <br/>
would just like to have a handful of non-specific boxes on hand when I <br/>
travel so I could just leave a little something behind without having <br/>
to travel with all my carving stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else feel this way?<br/>
