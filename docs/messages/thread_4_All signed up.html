who have now started planting boxes and taking up where I left off... one of<br/>
them is my niece, Deidre, or "Dee" -- but there's also Misty (so there's a<br/>
play on names here). As co-moderators, all they have to do is get folks<br/>
invited to the group, and make everyone feel welcome... If anyone has a<br/>
question, or needs some help, we'll find answers for them.<br/>
<br/>
I have some letterboxing friends here in California with LOTS of experience<br/>
who I can tap into. One of them is mentioned in the Time magazine article.<br/>
His name is Ryan, and his famous stamp is of a turtle with hiking boots on -<br/>
he's well-known by the letterboxing community. I bounce ideas for some of my<br/>
more unusual boxes off of him (such as my underwater box). He'd be happy to<br/>
help anyone in this group, too.<br/>
<br/>
As anyone in the area plants boxes, please post a message about the new box<br/>
here for this group. If you go hunting for boxes in New York, (even as far<br/>
away as Buffalo, Albany, Lake Placid, the Catskills or ??) tell the group<br/>
about your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe the folks in Misdeescrew would like to start by posting a message<br/>
about their Spy Island hunt and share it with others... then also let<br/>
everyone know a little bit about your latest box, Okay?<br/>
