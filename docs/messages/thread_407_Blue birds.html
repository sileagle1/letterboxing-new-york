I'll be very disappointed if you don't plant it in NY!  I really am a bird lover too.  I've got a number of bird feeders and numerous bird houses where families come back to each year (or so I like to think).<br/>

I think birds outnumber everything else, in terms of my stamp imagery.<br/>
<br/>
Nature at the Opera has a songbird in the series<br/>
Aquatic Birds<br/>
Astonishing Creatures:  The Sandhill Crane<br/>
Berkeley Repertory Theatre:  Brundibar uses bird imagery<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Endangered Species:  Nene, which I just planted, but not yet listed. <br/>
It is at a bird sanctuary in Kauai.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and my signature stamp, that bratty raven<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cheep cheep.  I have my wonderful grandmother to thank for my love of<br/>
nature.<br/>
