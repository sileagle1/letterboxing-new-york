bringing our honeys and our clues.<br/>

And we're each going to try each other's sport.<br/>

That is, if the weather isn't too awful....or we're too hung over from <br/>

<div>Yeah, we've been very busy between the holidays, work, overtime work, etc.  All died down now and the past two weeks I've been getting the shimy-shakes from want of carving, LOL! I did a box for the Desperately Seeking Sun event (Lockwench... will be shipped asap! Promise!). Carved a mini-stamp of my signature stamp for when we hunt for microboxes and letterboxes that have really small logbooks. Then I carved my first Personal Traveller!! I am so excited to bring it to the event in February... I've entered the clues on AtlasQuest and LBNA... it is called "Polish... and Proud of it!" LOL! ;o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night --on quite a rampage-- I carved a 4-stamp series for Howland Island Wildlife Refuge in central Cayuga County (Port Byron). Now I am sketching  for a Historic Auburn II. series- 6 designs are swirling around in my head. :o)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alas, earlier today -craving more "Pink Stuff"- I slipped out my already holiday-sore credit card and had quite the time on a super-furious Mister Art.com ordering binge.   *Hanging head in shame*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>FYI-- for anyone looking for Lock and Lock boxes (the ones with the side clamps)... I know someone mentioned awhile ago that the Tops grocery store in Rochester had them.... The Tops *and* Walmart in Auburn are now carrying big selections! So check your Tops and Wallyworld near you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*Sigh*, now off to balance the budget...</div>
