<div>Hi everyone!</div>
<div>The weather spoiled us this past weekend and I was fortunate enough to share 2 days of letterboxing with my fun loving fellow Wandering Wonders (phynstar, tamsyn, sahalie &amp; minpin lovers minus daytonatip).  If you haven't seen proof of the good laughs we had, check out the photos on Atlas Quest.  No more needs to be said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sahalie &amp; I planted the New York's Capital Hitch Hiker Hostel.  Look for the clues to be posted on Friday.  We also encountered a muggle when stopping for an Albany urban box.  He approached us as we sat on a bench, waiting for the area to clear and asked if we were on a "treasure hunt".  He couldn't respond to Sahalie's question of "which way is north?" so we engaged in verbal play that went in circles for about 5 minutes before he finally got frustrated with us and wandered away.  </div>

<div>Hope to see some of you at the Oneida mini-meet!  Sounds like an interesting place.....</div>
