                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1285770848">I have been thinking for awhile about hosting a traveling gathering which would follow  the <br/>
Keuka Lake wine trail and end at a spot where people could gather, exchange, potluck etc.. I <br/>
was having a talk with fairy gardner and Birch song who were thinking about doing winery <br/>
stampsand we thought this might wiork. I know gas prices are through the roof but I wanted <br/>
to see how many people might be intrested in attending such an event.  If this happens it will <br/>
be my first event and as such I'm reading through the event planner and getting some ideas <br/>
but any and all feed back I can get for any aspect of such a gather would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.  Also as the area where I live does not have lots in the way of boxes so I hope to <br/>
get some to plant at the evnt sight  Let the feedback roll.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everyday should be box day<br/>
