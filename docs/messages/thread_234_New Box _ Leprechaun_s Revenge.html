We were first finders for Lock Wench's Leprechaun's Revenge, a series <br/>
of 7 teeny-tiny (and we do mean extra wee!) boxes that stretch from <br/>
DeWitt to Utica. (Lock Wench, we fear that the one at the Indian Casino <br/>
is MIA, as 6 pairs of eyes couldn't spot it on or near the black <br/>
poles). If you hunt for them, think button-sized...<br/>
<br/>
We also made a side trip to the Fenner Windmill Farm, which is a very <br/>
nice location.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, before kids started climbing on me, I carved yet another <br/>
nice stamp, and may plant it today en route to Enchanted Forest water <br/>
park.<br/>
