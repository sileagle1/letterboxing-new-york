<br/>
But thanks for the shout out. I don't allow hem kissing, but a-- <br/>
kissing is still allowed. If the sight of my huge ghetto booty is <br/>
horrifying to you...you may kiss one of my many rings. LOL<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, I really enjoyed setting and reaching my own <br/>
little personal goal. I don't advise everyone to be this <br/>
crazy/insane/stubborn but it just goes to show you that even newbies <br/>
such as myself can make their mark in this hobby. I get a little <br/>
crabby reading some of the "holier than thou" comments on the big <br/>
board.  I truly feel that this hobby is SO new in the USA, that there <br/>
are plenty of ways a newbie can make a significant contribution. Just <br/>
look at Sprite and the Highlander and all the boxes in WNY because of <br/>
them!  And Paul in SF and his family's boxes populating the Mohawk <br/>
Valley...and Turtle McQ in the Finger Lakes area..and Catbead in the <br/>
Syracuse area and the Wizards of OZ in the Oswego area  and even you <br/>
in the Schoharie Valley....and it goes on and on..<br/>
<br/>
Pick a place....go forth...and PLANT! How often do you get to emulate <br/>
Johnny Appleseed anyway? :)<br/>
