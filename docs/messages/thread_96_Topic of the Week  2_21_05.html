under the noses of a group of people who just would not leave.  It was<br/>
getting late, we were tired and still had to drive home.  Our dog can<br/>
be quite the attention grabber when we get her jumping for sticks and<br/>
racing after a ball, so we had her perform.  Fly Doc had the box<br/>
tucked in his jacket, and when the group of people went back to their<br/>
conversation I *accidently* tossed the ball into the general hiding<br/>
area and Fly Doc just happened to have *trouble* picking it up.  Box<br/>
replaced and we left chuckling to ourselves that not one of the group<br/>
knew what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we do is Fly Doc acts as a lookout and gives a heads-up<br/>
whistle.  If there's time I'll go back to him, otherwise I'll grab the<br/>
camera and act like I'm taking pictures muttering things like "oh,<br/>
look at that", "isn't that beautiful", "look at that rock", etc.  So<br/>
far everyone's walked on by.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was without camera and someone walked by and asked what I was<br/>
doing (I was planting a box and had just enough time to turn &amp; take a<br/>
step away from it), the only thing I could think to say was that I was<br/>
admiring the ferns.  It seemed to satisfy them. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

a great way the other day while trying to snag a VERY conspicous box. <br/>
There was a loose garbage bag on the ground blowing around, so I just <br/>
pretend to be picking up garbage and dropped the box in! Putting it <br/>
back awa s little harder, but the Highlander held the bag open while <br/>
I pretended to go down for more, then replaced the box. Now we carry <br/>
the bag everywhere!<br/>
