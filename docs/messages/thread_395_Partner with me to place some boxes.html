Hi fellow NY boxers ... OK, well, I'm in MA, but I am a native NYer!<br/>
<br/>
I'll be heading home (Canandaigua area) for the Christmas holiday and<br/>
was thinking about maybe placing a box or two while I'm there. I've<br/>
wanted to place a number of boxes in the Finger Lakes since long<br/>
before many of you NY boxers were boxers, but never really got around<br/>
to it. Now that there are a growing number of NY boxers in the western<br/>
NY area, I'm quickly losing places to plant!<br/>
<br/>
But I'm determined to place a few never-the-less, and the week between<br/>
Christmas and New Years is the perfect time to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a number of ideas, but here's the rub -- I'm awful at carving!<br/>
Even if boxers don't mind poorly carved stamps, I know that the best<br/>
and most hunted boxes out there have nice art to reward the finder.<br/>
Besides, I don't really enjoy carving all that much.<br/>
<br/>
I've had success partnering with letterboxers to carve for me in the<br/>
past, including, Scarab, Choi, Team Randalstik, Talking Turtle, and<br/>
Jacks, and I seek to add to my list of carving partners to place some<br/>
NY boxes. If you like to carve but don't like to plant, or if you<br/>
enjoy carving enough to carve a stamp or two for another's letterbox,<br/>
send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:seh-letterbox@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seh-letterbox@...</a>. I'll post my ideas<br/>
here in another post later today or tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
You will get full credit for the stamp image. The catch this time is<br/>
that if you are willing to carve, I'd need to get the stamp from you<br/>
before I head home on December 23rd.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance!!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
