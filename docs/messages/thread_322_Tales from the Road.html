tickets to the American Idol tour (Soccerchick's a die-hard fan of <br/>
Anwar!) so we came up yesterday and are staying at my SIL's.  <br/>
<br/>
We're heading out to pick up a few boxes today, and taking my nephew, <br/>
his girlfriend, and her best friend along with us.  My nephew has gone <br/>
with me before, but this will be new to the girls.  They're looking <br/>
forward to checking letterboxing out, as it "sounds really neat" (that <br/>
means good in teenese).<br/>
<br/>
We'll keep you posted!<br/>
