</span></blockquote>Since I belong to 3 Yahoo! Letterboxing Groups: LbNA (the national <br/>
group), LbCNA (Northern California), and LbCNY (Central NY), it's <br/>
easy to forget which one you're posting messages to...<br/>
<br/>
In this case, I may have shared this info with Central NY simply to <br/>
inform them about geocaching. If you're not familiar with it, it's <br/>
somewhat like letterboxing, but uses GPS (Global Positioning Systems) <br/>
to give coordinates of "caches". Generally, there aren't puzzles to <br/>
solve, you put the coordinates in on your GPS system and go to that <br/>
spot. I believe they are accurate to within 10 feet. Their caches <br/>
don't have rubber stamps. Instead, there are small trinkets inside, <br/>
and you take one, and you leave one in its place.<br/>
<br/>
The word, Nepenthe, comes from Greek mythology. It was a potion that <br/>
caused forgetfulness of all troubles, worries, and sorrows. (Don't <br/>
you wish there was such a potion?)<br/>
<br/>
My letterbox, Nepenthe, <br/>
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/nepenthe.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/nepenthe.htm</a><br/>
a favorite of many people in this area, was in a beautiful, peaceful, <br/>
and relaxing location, suffered badly by being too close to a <br/>
geocache. In fact, it was in almost the exact same spot, but about 4 <br/>
feet below the geocache. What happened was that a geocacher found <br/>
Nepenthe, and thinking it was a cache, took the rubber stamp, and <br/>
left a dumb bottle cap in its place. (Letterboxers call <br/>
this "geotrashing). <br/>
<br/>
Later, someone else also made the mistake, but then found the cache, <br/>
too, and put Nepenthe up in the same niche as the cache. Then more <br/>
geocachers wrote all sorts of dumb things in the journal, and to <br/>
letterboxers, it looked like Nepenthe was missing. I was left with a <br/>
bottle cap, and a journal with remarks in it such as, "You will get <br/>
laid tonight". The letterboxing community, as I know it, is much more <br/>
considerate and thoughtful than these folks were. It was my first <br/>
encounter with a geocache, and not a good one.<br/>
<br/>
When I found Nepenthe with the geocache, I looked up the planter on <br/>
wwww.geocaching.org, and wrote them a polite e-mail (even though I <br/>
was fuming mad), asking if we could work out something so that this <br/>
wouldn't happen again. They never responded back. If I were a mean <br/>
and nasty person (believe me, I'm tempted), I would remove their <br/>
cache.<br/>
<br/>
For people who had found Nepenthe and e-mailed me, I offered to send <br/>
them a piece of beautiful music (MP3), entitled Nepenthe, that <br/>
inspired the box, and related it to a personal story about my visit <br/>
to a place in the Greek Isles 16 years ago in 1988: Lindos on the <br/>
Island of Rhodes. There, the remains of a ancient greek temple to <br/>
Helios, the sun god, stands at the top of a 400 foot cliff <br/>
overlooking the deep blue Aegean Sea. At that time, I had just been <br/>
diagnosed with a very fatal disease, and didn't expect to live past <br/>
one year. While I stood there, depressed, I thought to myself that I <br/>
would never return to that spot again.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you see I'm still alive and healthy. And I returned to Lindos <br/>
in 2001. In my living room are 2 photos taken of me at the exact same <br/>
spot -- miraculously. They serve to remind me that I need to always <br/>
reserve some hope for the possibility of the impossible happening.<br/>
<br/>
THAT'S what I wanted the geocacher to realize that my letterbox, <br/>
Nepenthe, stood for. If you read towards the end of my clues for <br/>
Nepenthe, you'll see that it stands for the blessings of family, <br/>
friends, and life.<br/>
<br/>
It's a long story, but an important one.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to send anyone in this group the music as well. It's a <br/>
large file (2.5 MB), so Hotmail accounts, for example, won't accept <br/>
it. Most people can receive it without a problem. E-mail me at <br/>
<a href="mailto:pgonyea@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pgonyea@...</a> if you'd like to hear it.<br/>

<br/>
I'm aware of one case of a stamp being taken by a geocacher, and with<br/>
persistence it was returned to its rightful owner.  I think the owner<br/>
not only emailed the person who took the stamp, but went on the<br/>
geocache website and posted message(s) asking for its return.  By now,<br/>
your stamp may have been traded &amp; left in another cache.  Maybe by<br/>
posting a message it will be seen by the person who has it, or has<br/>
seen it, and they will contact you.  It also wouldn't hurt to expand<br/>
their knowledge base.  Who knows, next time someone will recognise a<br/>
letterbox and leave it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Not all geocachers are tramplers and destroyers, some are careful,<br/>
considerate folks who also letterbox....although to anyone who's had<br/>
their box hijacked or destroyed that's probably not very comforting. <br/>
I'd be pretty angry myself if it happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get it back.<br/>
Take care,<br/>
