<p>Ryan - </p>
<p>Thanks for posting about this. I am not that thrilled about planting in state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those lesser known places that they might not have seen before. Most of my 16 (out of 215!) state park boxes are in lesser known and visited state parks. But having worked with NY State Parks personnel before (I used to work for a prominent architecture/landscape architecture firm here in NY), I tried to anticipate their concerns and so planted "location" based stamps. You know what I mean... the stamp was about the place and I gave a lot of background about the area and sang it's praises....trying to educate the public. I enjoy finding location stamps myself (so looking at my logbook is sort of like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I also love learning about new places and I find that searchers of my boxes are appreciative of that sort of thing as well. In the beginning, I just carved anything that struck my fancy, but now I carve mostly location boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus" box thrown in.</p>
<p>The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have been really cool and happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had my box moved slightly, as they were doing some trail work. When I plant, I make sure I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such as fern beds and the like. It's easy to pick up a brochure about the area BEFORE you plant, learn something about the place and then avoid the sensitive spots. I avoid animal holes in trees, placing boxes in ancient rock walls etc. I anticipate the path that might form to the box and so make that path over rocks or pine needles or similar non-sensitive ground cover. I learned from Catbead that under a bridge is a good hiding place for just this reason! All those long hikes with my parents while my mother droned on about plants and their latin names (blah blah blah) must have sunk in a little! lol</p>
<p>After I read your post, I went back through my list and was pleasantly surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10 parks. I think I will take the tactic of contacting each of the park personnel that I haven't spoken to already and let them know about my box, invite them to find it by providing them the clues, and asking them to contact me to pick up the box if they feel it is in an inappropriate area or needs a permit. I've introduced more than a couple of park personnel to letterboxing this way and they seem to enjoy the fact that I lead them RIGHT TO THE BOX, as the majority of my boxes are hidden with families in mind. I encourage all New Yorkers to give letterboxers a good reputation as land and nature stewards by doing the same.</p>

&gt; Although I love the secretive nature of this hobby,<br/>

I am not saying that all geocachers follow this policy, but in general, the geocachers <strong>that I know</strong> ( do y'all know I was once a geocacher?... I gave it up pretty quickly) look upon letterboxers as more "rogue" players, in that the general consensus has been to "plant first and explain later." I am not saying all letterboxers do not ask permission before planting! This is only the impression I get from reading 15 different boards on this topic and speaking with over 100 experienced and inexperienced  letterboxers. Several state parks have been working closely with geocachers and have good relationships with them, and host many geocache events.such as those at Letchworth. Geocaching has official sponsors and the like.  I myself prefer the "whispered..never shouted" aspect of letterboxing and even teach small classes with this in

I think it is a personal decision each letterboxer will have to make (Move the box? or  Register the box?)  but I am hoping that letterboxers will not try to circumvent the system and get all of our boxes pulled.

I am not that<br/>&gt; thrilled about planting in<br/>&gt; state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to<br/>&gt; those lesser known<br/>&gt; places that they might not have seen before. Most of<br/>&gt; my 16 (out of 215!)<br/>&gt; state park boxes are in lesser known and visited<br/>&gt; state parks. But having<br/>&gt; worked with NY State Parks personnel before (I used<br/>&gt; to work for a<br/>&gt; prominent architecture/ landscape architecture firm<br/>&gt; here in NY), I tried<br/>&gt; to anticipate their concerns and so planted<br/>&gt; "location" based stamps. You<br/>&gt; know what I mean... the stamp was about the place<br/>&gt; and I gave a lot of<br/>&gt; background
 about the area and sang it's<br/>&gt; praises....trying to educate the<br/>&gt; public. I enjoy finding location stamps myself (so<br/>&gt; looking at my logbook<br/>&gt; is sort of like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!).<br/>&gt; I also love<br/>&gt; learning about new places and I find that searchers<br/>&gt; of my boxes are<br/>&gt; appreciative of that sort of thing as well. In the<br/>&gt; beginning, I just<br/>&gt; carved anything that struck my fancy, but now I<br/>&gt; carve mostly location<br/>&gt; boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus"<br/>&gt; box thrown in.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have<br/>&gt; been really cool and<br/>&gt; happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had<br/>&gt; my box moved<br/>&gt; slightly, as they were doing some trail work. When I<br/>&gt; plant, I make sure<br/>&gt; I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such as<br/>&gt; fern beds and the<br/>&gt; like. It's easy to pick up a brochure about the
 area<br/>&gt; BEFORE you plant,<br/>&gt; learn something about the place and then avoid the<br/>&gt; sensitive spots. I<br/>&gt; avoid animal holes in trees, placing boxes in<br/>&gt; ancient rock walls etc. I<br/>&gt; anticipate the path that might form to the box and<br/>&gt; so make that path<br/>&gt; over rocks or pine needles or similar non-sensitive<br/>&gt; ground cover. I<br/>&gt; learned from Catbead that under a bridge is a good<br/>&gt; hiding place for just<br/>&gt; this reason! All those long hikes with my parents<br/>&gt; while my mother droned<br/>&gt; on about plants and their latin names (blah blah<br/>&gt; blah) must have sunk in<br/>&gt; a little! lol<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; After I read your post, I went back through my list<br/>&gt; and was pleasantly<br/>&gt; surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10<br/>&gt; parks. I think I will<br/>&gt; take the tactic of contacting each of the park<br/>&gt; personnel that I haven't<br/>&gt; spoken to already and let them know about my
 box,<br/>&gt; invite them to find it<br/>&gt; by providing them the clues, and asking them to<br/>&gt; contact me to pick up<br/>&gt; the box if they feel it is in an inappropriate area<br/>&gt; or needs a permit.<br/>&gt; I've introduced more than a couple of park personnel<br/>&gt; to letterboxing<br/>&gt; this way and they seem to enjoy the fact that I lead<br/>&gt; them RIGHT TO THE<br/>&gt; BOX, as the majority of my boxes are hidden with<br/>&gt; families in mind. I<br/>&gt; encourage all New Yorkers to give letterboxers a<br/>&gt; good reputation as land<br/>&gt; and nature stewards by doing the same.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; LW<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Although I love the secretive nature of this hobby,<br/>&gt; I do think that New<br/>&gt; York State Parks have done a good job of working<br/>&gt; WITH letterboxers,<br/>&gt; instead of banning the hobby as other states have<br/>&gt; done.

<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">I have a series placed in a state 
park.  These boxes are singular to their location as they commemorate a 
yearly event at the park.  However, of the two personal decisions you 
propose, ('Move the box? or Register the box?') I will do neither.  I am 
definitely in the 'plant first, explain later' group of letterboxers.  Part 
of this is because of the inherent secrecy of the hobby.  While I know not 
everyone subscribes to this view of the hobby, and I certainly don't believe 
letterboxing should be 100% exclusionary, I do believe that secrecy or stealth 
is integral to the hobby.  If not, why do we *hide* boxes?  Why do you 
need clues to find boxes?  Why do we frown upon folks who give hints about 
box locations or publish stamp images?  Why do we use pseudonyms, i.e. 
trail names?  Why do we emphasize correct rehiding to keep the box from 
being found?  To me, part of this game's uniqueness lies in its 'under the 
radar' status and the stealth required to find the boxes 
undetected.</font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">If we start asking permission, where do we 
stop?  All land is owned by someone - private parties or municipal 
authorities.  You can say we should ask permission of the state parks 
because they are the ones making an issue of it at this time.  
But do we really think that town, city authorities, business owners or private 
property owners would really want boxes planted on their property if they knew 
of them?  If we believe it is the right of state park officials to regulate 
the planting of letterboxes on state property because they know of the hobby, 
isn't it a little intellectually dishonest to deprive another individual of the 
right to regulate planting on their property just because they haven't been 
informed of the practice?  Are we prepared to ask permission for every box 
we plant?</font></div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Palatino Linotype">If a box is correctly and securely hid, 
ideally it should be found by no one without a clue in hand.  If it isn't 
hid or rehid securely and is found by a nonboxer, it is litter, pure and 
simple.  I can't tell you the times I have found boxes that were hid in 
questionable locations that couldn't, no way, no how, contain them 
secretly.  Numerous times I have come across boxes that were visible in 
their hiding places, saved only from detection in that they were in remote 
locations.  We need to start hiding and rehiding our boxes better so that 
detection of them is not an issue.  If a box is correctly hid and is 
findable only by a letterboxer, looking for it, clues in hand, and the 
regulating authority of the property, be it individual or organizational, never 
knows the box is there, then my take on it is 'no harm, no 
foul'.  This is just my 2 cents and (as Trailhoundz likes to say) 
with NYS taxes, worth about a penny. :-)  </font></div>

<div>Geocachers have a written and posted policy in place to work with state 
  park personnel BEFORE they plant a geocache. I am not saying that all 
  geocachers follow this policy, but in general, the geocachers <strong>that I 
  know</strong> ( do y'all know I was once a geocacher?.. . I gave it up 
  pretty quickly) look upon letterboxers as more "rogue" players, in that the 
  general consensus has been to "plant first and explain later." I am not saying 
  all letterboxers do not ask permission before planting! This is only the 
  impression I get from reading 15 different boards on this topic and speaking 
  with over 100 experienced and inexperienced  letterboxers. Several state 
  parks have been working closely with geocachers and have good relationships 
  with them, and host many geocache events.such as those at Letchworth. 
  Geocaching has official sponsors and the like.  I myself prefer the 
  "whispered.. never shouted" aspect of letterboxing and even teach small 
  classe mind, as education seems the best way to give our hobby a good 
  name.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rather than bemoan the way  geocaching/geocache rs operate, we 
  can emulate one of the better ideas (respecting the fact that SP will now want 
  permits for letterboxes) and either decide to remove our boxes and plant 
  elsewhere or work with the system in place. I think it is a personal decision 
  each letterboxer will have to make (Move the box? 
  or  Register the box?)  but I am hoping that letterboxers 
  will not try to circumvent the system and get all of our boxes pulled. Just my 
  own opinion. </div>

If we start asking permission, where do we stop?  All land is owned <br/>
by someone - private parties or municipal authorities.  You can say <br/>
we should ask permission of the state parks because they are the <br/>
ones making an issue of it at this time.  But do we really think <br/>
that town, city authorities, business owners or private property <br/>
owners would really want boxes planted on their property if they <br/>
knew of them?  If we believe it is the right of state park officials <br/>
to regulate the planting of letterboxes on state property because <br/>
they know of the hobby, isn't it a little intellectually dishonest <br/>
to deprive another individual of the right to regulate planting on <br/>
their property just because they haven't been informed of the <br/>
practice?  Are we prepared to ask permission for every box we plant?<br/>
<br/>
If a box is correctly and securely hid, ideally it should be found <br/>
by no one without a clue in hand.  If it isn't hid or rehid securely <br/>
and is found by a nonboxer, it is litter, pure and simple.  I can't <br/>
tell you the times I have found boxes that were hid in questionable <br/>
locations that couldn't, no way, no how, contain them secretly.  <br/>
Numerous times I have come across boxes that were visible in their <br/>
hiding places, saved only from detection in that they were in remote <br/>
locations.  We need to start hiding and rehiding our boxes better so <br/>
that detection of them is not an issue.  If a box is correctly hid <br/>
and is findable only by a letterboxer, looking for it, clues in <br/>
hand, and the regulating authority of the property, be it individual <br/>
or organizational, never knows the box is there, then my take on it <br/>
is 'no harm, no foul'.  This is just my 2 cents and (as Trailhoundz <br/>
likes to say) with NYS taxes, worth about a penny. :-)  <br/>

Can we have a discussion about this? I would love to hear points of <br/>
view from others and how they handled their similar  situation. Did <br/>
you encounter nice Park personnel willing to work with you? Did you <br/>
design learning  about the location into your stamp/box?  Did you <br/>
just pull the box or did you ask for a permit? Let's hear from you <br/>
all out there!<br/>
&gt;   Post from Ryan on Atlasquest: Hello, New Yorkers! =) I got this <br/>
e-mail a few minutes ago from a guy in the New York SP system:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "You should be advised that permission is needed via permit from <br/>
New York State Park Managers in order to place a letter box in a <br/>
state park. There are rules for geocaches that also apply to <br/>
letterboxes. (state park management has set spefic rules for <br/>
placement of such things) Most park managers will work with you in <br/>
placement of the letterboxes when done so through the park manager. <br/>
When letterboxes are found without the proper permit they will most <br/>
likely be removed and the owner notified."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure if he's refering to a specific box or not, but let it <br/>
be known, permits are needed if you want to plant a box in a New <br/>
York SP and they DO know about Atlas Quest so don't think you can <br/>
sneak around them by posting here instead of LbNA. ;o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; Mail from Ryan:<br/>
&gt;   I wasn't sure if the ranger from the New York State Parks was e-<br/>
mailing me about a specific box or not and asked, and this was the <br/>
reply:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Ryan,<br/>
&gt; I apologize for not being specific. There was a box put in the <br/>
Minna Anthony<br/>
&gt; Common Nature Center called something like Girls Night Out, I <br/>
found it, removed itand emailed the owner. Getting permission to put <br/>
the box in a park is quite easy<br/>
&gt; the person just has to ask and follow the rules! Thanks for <br/>
getting back to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Randy "<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is that you? =) I can't find a box called "Girls Night Out" on AQ, <br/>
but I swear I've heard it before and I swear it sounds like <br/>
something you would do. ;o)<br/>

&gt; -- Ryan<br/>
&gt;   My response on AQ<br/>
&gt;   Ryan - <br/>
&gt;   Thanks for posting about this. I am not that thrilled about <br/>
planting in state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those <br/>
lesser known places that they might not have seen before. Most of my <br/>
16 (out of 215!) state park boxes are in lesser known and visited <br/>
state parks. But having worked with NY State Parks personnel before <br/>
(I used to work for a prominent architecture/landscape architecture <br/>
firm here in NY), I tried to anticipate their concerns and so <br/>
planted "location" based stamps. You know what I mean... the stamp <br/>
was about the place and I gave a lot of background about the area <br/>
and sang it's praises....trying to educate the public. I enjoy <br/>
finding location stamps myself (so looking at my logbook is sort of <br/>
like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I also love learning about <br/>
new places and I find that searchers of my boxes are appreciative of <br/>
that sort of thing as well. In the beginning, I just carved anything <br/>
that struck my fancy, but now I carve mostly location<br/>
&gt;  boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus" box thrown <br/>
in.<br/>
&gt;   The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have been really <br/>
cool and happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had my box <br/>
moved slightly, as they were doing some trail work. When I plant, I <br/>
make sure I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such as fern <br/>
beds and the like. It's easy to pick up a brochure about the area <br/>
BEFORE you plant, learn something about the place and then avoid the <br/>
sensitive spots. I avoid animal holes in trees, placing boxes in <br/>
ancient rock walls etc. I anticipate the path that might form to the <br/>
box and so make that path over rocks or pine needles or similar non-<br/>
sensitive ground cover. I learned from Catbead that under a bridge <br/>
is a good hiding place for just this reason! All those long hikes <br/>
with my parents while my mother droned on about plants and their <br/>
latin names (blah blah blah) must have sunk in a little! lol<br/>
&gt;   After I read your post, I went back through my list and was <br/>
pleasantly surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10 parks. I <br/>
think I will take the tactic of contacting each of the park <br/>
personnel that I haven't spoken to already and let them know about <br/>
my box, invite them to find it by providing them the clues, and <br/>
asking them to contact me to pick up the box if they feel it is in <br/>
an inappropriate area or needs a permit. I've introduced more than a <br/>
couple of park personnel to letterboxing this way and they seem to <br/>
enjoy the fact that I lead them RIGHT TO THE BOX, as the majority of <br/>
my boxes are hidden with families in mind. I encourage all New <br/>
Yorkers to give letterboxers a good reputation as land and nature <br/>
stewards by doing the same.<br/>
&gt;   LW<br/>
&gt;   Although I love the secretive nature of this hobby, I do think <br/>
that New York State Parks have done a good job of working WITH <br/>
letterboxers, instead of banning the hobby as other states have <br/>
done.  Please share your own experiences.<br/>

to the lids.  THat was the first that I heard of the whole permit <br/>
thing.  It certainly didn't change anything about the search and find <br/>
for me, and I have to say that if they know how to find AQ and lbna, <br/>
then hiding a box on the sly and then posting the clues there is a <br/>
good way to get it yanked and lose all the time and effort put into <br/>
it.  I hid a box indoors without asking permission and it disappeared <br/>
before being found.  I wouldn't know who to get permission from for <br/>
my traffic circle boxes, but one of them seems to be missing too.  <br/>
NYS parks cooperation in registering and planting boxes may be a <br/>
blessing in disguise as it does afford them some protections at least <br/>
from being removed by an employee maintaining a trail.  It may also <br/>
help get them back in the right place if they are found by a non-<br/>
boxer because they weren't rehidden properly.  I would turn in a box <br/>
with an official permit taped to it!<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell you how many boxes I found around Cooperstown this <br/>
summer that were completely exposed, not rehidden at all.  It seemed <br/>
to be a group of kids who had found it last, but they weren't on Lbna <br/>
so I couldn't contact them to educate them about how IMPORTANT it is <br/>
to rehide boxes well.  That town is immaculately groomed, and if I <br/>
hadn't been boxing a day behind them those boxes could have been lost.<br/>

pay up the fine with much wailing, gnashing of teeth and bemoaning <br/>

<br/>
The cat is definitely out of the bag with letterboxing.  There has <br/>
been phenomenal growth in the activity in the short time I have been <br/>
letterboxing.  My personal preference would be for a slower, more <br/>
organic growth as opposed to active publicity.  The one thing that <br/>
is great about this hobby is that within its constraints, it can be <br/>
different things for different people.  For me, discussions such as <br/>
this one, illuminate the differences and bring greater understanding <br/>
of how others view this activity. <br/>

Personally, the government is up in my business enough on a day to <br/>
day basis.  I will take my chances and play my game as much as <br/>
possible without their regulation.<br/>

&gt; not everyone subscribes to this view of the hobby, and I certainly <br/>
&gt; don't believe letterboxing should be 100% exclusionary, I do <br/>
believe <br/>
&gt; that secrecy or stealth is integral to the hobby. If not, why do <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; *hide* boxes? Why do you need clues to find boxes? Why do we frown <br/>
&gt; upon folks who give hints about box locations or publish stamp <br/>
&gt; images? Why do we use pseudonyms, i.e. trail names? Why do we <br/>
&gt; emphasize correct rehiding to keep the box from being found? To <br/>
me, <br/>
&gt; part of this game's uniqueness lies in its 'under the radar' <br/>
status <br/>
&gt; and the stealth required to find the boxes undetected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we start asking permission, where do we stop? All land is owned <br/>
&gt; by someone - private parties or municipal authorities. You can say <br/>
&gt; we should ask permission of the state parks because they are the <br/>
&gt; ones making an issue of it at this time. But do we really think <br/>
&gt; that town, city authorities, business owners or private property <br/>
&gt; owners would really want boxes planted on their property if they <br/>
&gt; knew of them? If we believe it is the right of state park <br/>
officials <br/>
&gt; to regulate the planting of letterboxes on state property because <br/>
&gt; they know of the hobby, isn't it a little intellectually dishonest <br/>
&gt; to deprive another individual of the right to regulate planting on <br/>
&gt; their property just because they haven't been informed of the <br/>
&gt; practice? Are we prepared to ask permission for every box we plant?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a box is correctly and securely hid, ideally it should be found <br/>
&gt; by no one without a clue in hand. If it isn't hid or rehid <br/>
securely <br/>
&gt; and is found by a nonboxer, it is litter, pure and simple. I can't <br/>
&gt; tell you the times I have found boxes that were hid in <br/>
questionable <br/>
&gt; locations that couldn't, no way, no how, contain them secretly. <br/>
&gt; Numerous times I have come across boxes that were visible in their <br/>
&gt; hiding places, saved only from detection in that they were in <br/>
remote <br/>
&gt; locations. We need to start hiding and rehiding our boxes better <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; that detection of them is not an issue. If a box is correctly hid <br/>
&gt; and is findable only by a letterboxer, looking for it, clues in <br/>
&gt; hand, and the regulating authority of the property, be it <br/>
individual <br/>
&gt; or organizational, never knows the box is there, then my take on <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; is 'no harm, no foul'. This is just my 2 cents and (as Trailhoundz <br/>
&gt; likes to say) with NYS taxes, worth about a penny. :-) <br/>

&gt; with a personal note I received from Ryan and my posted response. <br/>
&gt; Can we have a discussion about this? I would love to hear points <br/>
of <br/>

&gt; you encounter nice Park personnel willing to work with you? Did <br/>
you <br/>

&gt; just pull the box or did you ask for a permit? Let's hear from you <br/>
&gt; all out there!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Post from Ryan on Atlasquest: Hello, New Yorkers! =) I got this <br/>
&gt; e-mail a few minutes ago from a guy in the New York SP system:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "You should be advised that permission is needed via permit from <br/>
&gt; New York State Park Managers in order to place a letter box in a <br/>
&gt; state park. There are rules for geocaches that also apply to <br/>
&gt; letterboxes. (state park management has set spefic rules for <br/>
&gt; placement of such things) Most park managers will work with you in <br/>
&gt; placement of the letterboxes when done so through the park <br/>
manager. <br/>
&gt; When letterboxes are found without the proper permit they will <br/>
most <br/>
&gt; likely be removed and the owner notified."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure if he's refering to a specific box or not, but let <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; be known, permits are needed if you want to plant a box in a New <br/>
&gt; York SP and they DO know about Atlas Quest so don't think you can <br/>
&gt; sneak around them by posting here instead of LbNA. ;o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mail from Ryan:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wasn't sure if the ranger from the New York State Parks was e-<br/>
&gt; mailing me about a specific box or not and asked, and this was the <br/>
&gt; reply:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Ryan,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I apologize for not being specific. There was a box put in the <br/>
&gt; Minna Anthony<br/>
&gt; &gt; Common Nature Center called something like Girls Night Out, I <br/>
&gt; found it, removed itand emailed the owner. Getting permission to <br/>
put <br/>
&gt; the box in a park is quite easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; the person just has to ask and follow the rules! Thanks for <br/>
&gt; getting back to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Randy "<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is that you? =) I can't find a box called "Girls Night Out" on <br/>
AQ, <br/>
&gt; but I swear I've heard it before and I swear it sounds like <br/>
&gt; something you would do. ;o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -- Ryan<br/>
&gt; &gt; My response on AQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ryan - <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for posting about this. I am not that thrilled about <br/>
&gt; planting in state parks anyway, as I try to bring people to those <br/>
&gt; lesser known places that they might not have seen before. Most of <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; 16 (out of 215!) state park boxes are in lesser known and visited <br/>
&gt; state parks. But having worked with NY State Parks personnel <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; (I used to work for a prominent architecture/landscape <br/>
architecture <br/>
&gt; firm here in NY), I tried to anticipate their concerns and so <br/>
&gt; planted "location" based stamps. You know what I mean... the stamp <br/>
&gt; was about the place and I gave a lot of background about the area <br/>
&gt; and sang it's praises....trying to educate the public. I enjoy <br/>
&gt; finding location stamps myself (so looking at my logbook is sort <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; like a roadmap of everywhere I've been!). I also love learning <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; new places and I find that searchers of my boxes are appreciative <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; that sort of thing as well. In the beginning, I just carved <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; that struck my fancy, but now I carve mostly location<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes with perhaps the occasional nearby fun "bonus" box thrown <br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The few park personnel that HAVE contacted me have been really <br/>
&gt; cool and happy to let me leave my boxes as is. Only one had my box <br/>
&gt; moved slightly, as they were doing some trail work. When I plant, <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; make sure I avoid nesting areas and sensitive plants such as fern <br/>
&gt; beds and the like. It's easy to pick up a brochure about the area <br/>
&gt; BEFORE you plant, learn something about the place and then avoid <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; sensitive spots. I avoid animal holes in trees, placing boxes in <br/>
&gt; ancient rock walls etc. I anticipate the path that might form to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; box and so make that path over rocks or pine needles or similar <br/>
non-<br/>
&gt; sensitive ground cover. I learned from Catbead that under a bridge <br/>
&gt; is a good hiding place for just this reason! All those long hikes <br/>
&gt; with my parents while my mother droned on about plants and their <br/>
&gt; latin names (blah blah blah) must have sunk in a little! lol<br/>
&gt; &gt; After I read your post, I went back through my list and was <br/>
&gt; pleasantly surprised that my 16 state park boxes are in 10 parks. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; think I will take the tactic of contacting each of the park <br/>
&gt; personnel that I haven't spoken to already and let them know about <br/>
&gt; my box, invite them to find it by providing them the clues, and <br/>
&gt; asking them to contact me to pick up the box if they feel it is in <br/>
&gt; an inappropriate area or needs a permit. I've introduced more than <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; couple of park personnel to letterboxing this way and they seem to <br/>
&gt; enjoy the fact that I lead them RIGHT TO THE BOX, as the majority <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; my boxes are hidden with families in mind. I encourage all New <br/>
&gt; Yorkers to give letterboxers a good reputation as land and nature <br/>
&gt; stewards by doing the same.<br/>
&gt; &gt; LW<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although I love the secretive nature of this hobby, I do think <br/>
&gt; that New York State Parks have done a good job of working WITH <br/>
&gt; letterboxers, instead of banning the hobby as other states have <br/>
&gt; done. Please share your own experiences.<br/>

gone,When I say heyday, I mean when it was an "underground" activity. I've<br/>

attacked for it. But my opinions stay the same. The cat *is* out of the bag<br/>
and the barn door is already open. What was once a truly original and<br/>
unique hobby passed along by WOM is fast becoming a bland and white bread<br/>
activity practiced by far too many people who will get bored and move on<br/>
the next hobby, leaving unattended boxes to go missing and be destroyed<br/>
while they remain listed on AQ and LBNA. And by quite a few people who seem<br/>
to have to actually ask other boxers how to get ideas of where and what<br/>
kinds of boxes to place. If you don't have the imagination to come up with<br/>
locations, stamps and themes on your own, this ain't the hobby for you.You<br/>
have to have at least some small crumb of talent and imagination to do this<br/>
hobby. Too many people who really just do not get it are starting to box.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1748570012"><div><strong>My</strong> point is, no one has to plant in State Parks!  There are literally thousands of places one can plant without dealing with State Park regulations at all! I like bringing people to lesser known places...but this has included some of the State Parks that could really use the funding that greater patronage brings. When I plant in a park I am hoping the letterbox enjoys the area enough to come back with family and friends.I don't need the park to put a sign up or provide maps to boxes, etc etc.  I support the parks and the NY State park personnel as they do their best to make sure these properties can be enjoyed by all. I don't want these beautiful properties to ever be sold to private owners or entities where they are fenced off from the public. My taxes support them, and I deserve access to these properties but am willing to help them protect and preserve them by playing by the rules. Yes, I don't bring glass container to the
 beaches; yes I will  make my campsite quiet by 10 pm so others can sleep: yes I will carry out anything I have carried in; yes I will follow their rules for safe and responsible placement of my boxes in their parks or risk eviction. I agree it is horrible that it has come to this, but that's why responsible education about our hobby  is so important. </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>In my own opinion,</strong> when I learned the Girl Scouts were publishing and promoting letterboxing ( I achieved the rank of Cadet, back in the day, btw) I knew letterboxing would be forever changed. Not that I have anything against the Scouts, as I know leaders (such as my mother) work hard to teach respect and knowledge about nature and playing by the rules. But just by sheer numbers of Scouts across the nation and publicity in Family Fun,  Time Magazine, etc..the days of no public knowledge about
 letterboxing are over...kaput..finished. But that is not to say that we cannot shape letterboxing into what we want it to be! Geocachers have been extremely successful at this, like Jackbear has stated. Their educational emphasis and Cache In-Trash Out policies and willingness to work with park personnel has endeared them to some agencies, as they have demonstrated a willingness to follow the rules and be responsible for their caches, or face their removal. Do all Geocachers play by their own rules? No. Do all letterboxers play by our limited rules? No. It's why proper education is going to save this hobby from bad press. Secrets shared on this big of a scale rarely remain secret. :)</div> <div> </div> <div>As a mother, I am happy to share a hobby that gets kids (and adults!)  off the couch, exercising and into the woods or to a local historical site where they can learn a little more about the world around them. My own
 parents did this without the fun of letterboxing and I often wish letterboxing had been around to add another dimension to our fun. I also think it's good to set an example for kids that rules are in place for a reason. Any letterbox of mine that is discovered is an opportunity to show how I will work with the finder and hopefully introduce them to letterboxing in an educational way.</div> <div> </div> <div>Do I have secret, WOM boxes in edgy places?  Yes.. Do I whisper clues in children's ears or drop a cootie into the bag of an unsuspecting boxer? Yep. Hasn't killed the secret aspect of letterboxing for me at all. In fact, besides the 200 boxes I have posted publicly so people can enjoy them,  I swap clues with folks I know,  just as those earliest of the letterboxers did with each other....</div> <div> </div> <div>But don't ask me to get  "official sponsors" such as Jeep to "promote" letterboxing. I am
 liking the growth just fine without benefit of sponsors....and you'll set me off for an even bigger tirade....*grin* I think that is the day letterboxing will die for me.....</div> <div> </div> <div>LW * who has been asked to teach a beginning letterbox class by the authorities at a National Historic Site..who discovered her box, were pleased by the historical lesson included and now lovingly maintain the box for her*</div> <div> </div> <div><br/><br/><b><i>Jen Z &lt;jenzstudio@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1748570012replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1748570012ygrp-text">

To make a long story short, why don't we just accept responsibility <br/>
for our boxes. Maintain them better, only hide in places that are <br/>
absolutely secure and practically foolproof, don't overpopulate an <br/>
area and don't over-extend yourself. If you find yourself the least <br/>
bit hesitant about a location -for whatever reason- don't plant <br/>
there. (This is why I have a drawer in my craftyroom full of ready-<br/>
to-be-planted boxes. I just haven't been satisfied with any of the <br/>
locales that I've checked out, and I don't want to plant them far <br/>
enough away that I can't stop in and check on them.)<br/>
<br/>
Making things more challenging will probably keep boxes alive <br/>
longer. If 'joe letterboxer' is just out for numbers and sees that a <br/>
particular planters letterboxes tend to be tricky, he's likely to <br/>
skip them in the future. <br/>

finally being discussed (thanks Ryan), as the <br/>
cat's been out of the bag on this one for a good <br/>
year, year and a half.<br/>
<br/>
I like planting in State Parks.  Most of my boxes <br/>
are in large (State) parks.  Most of my boxes are <br/>
part of a series that will take the seeker along <br/>
beautiful trails, to explore and discover what <br/>
they might never see.  This was my evil plan from <br/>
the beginning. :-)  I love the particular parks <br/>
I've planted in, and if someone was willing to <br/>
come all this way to find my boxes, I wanted to <br/>
make it worth their while, especially after <br/>
paying an entrance fee.  Now that the price of <br/>
gas is so high, I think it's even more important <br/>
that a boxer can drive to one spot, park and <br/>
spend the day boxing.  I figure the entrance fee <br/>
is about the same as 2 gallons of gas, and for <br/>
those who have an Empire Pass like we have, then <br/>
by now it's already paid for itself and they get <br/>
in free.<br/>
<br/>
When I started boxing there weren't many boxes in <br/>
this part of CNY, then a few years later it <br/>
really started to boom, and now they are <br/>
everywhere. :-)  We've spent many a happy <br/>
afternoon doing these quick boxes, but now with <br/>
gas prices the way they are, not to mention the <br/>
exhaust/global warming thing (hello Toyota get <br/>
with the hybrid mini-van), I'm thinking twice <br/>
about spending $40 in gas on these local jaunts - <br/>
no matter how carefully mapped out they are it's <br/>
still a lot of starting, stopping, city traffic <br/>
driving (but I must say stamping in with the AC <br/>
blasting in a skeeter free atmosphere can't be <br/>
beat on a hot muggy).<br/>
<br/>
So, the parks now require registration, and box <br/>
limits, and are finally turning their attention <br/>
to letterboxes.  Well, that's the way it is. <br/>
That they are in friendly attitude to us is <br/>
because of geocachers who behaved responsibly is <br/>
to my (all of our) benefit.  If a limit is <br/>
enforced, then for a series, I'll probably rotate <br/>
what's out, for example in an 8 part series have <br/>
the first 4 planted for so long then pull them <br/>
and plant the last 4.  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Things change in life and one just has to roll with it.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-610008578">Civil disobedience. What a concept! <br/>
<br/>
But seriously, in NYS, there are hundreds of miles of trails in public<br/>
use areas other than state parks. If a letterboxer feels he/she wishes<br/>
to get permission to plant a box or boxes in places that require it,<br/>
then by all means do so. If not, then don't. <br/>
<br/>
Civil disobedience is not a concept new to letterboxing. It's been a<br/>
practice for years.  <br/>

<div>I see no reason whatsoever for the find count to be hooked up with deleting a box. I think it's done that way because the site ower feels there is no reason to delete a box and wants to prevent people from doing it. So hooking it up with deleting finds will deter people from doing it. I am totally grateful for all the work he does on the site and he seems like a really nice guy, but I just think some of the things he does are a bit much. And I feel like if I say anything on the bbs there, people will jump down my throat. I should be free to say what I feel, but I don't feel like I am. </div>

&gt; As for the dead box thing...that's why I am so<br/>

&gt; quite a few people who seem<br/>

&gt; have to have at least some small crumb of talent and<br/>

&gt; hobby. Too many people who really just do not get it<br/>

&gt; &gt; This really stinks. I wish LB'ing could--well, to<br/>
&gt; steal Artichoke's<br/>
&gt; wording (sorry artichoke!)-- grow organically by WOM<br/>
&gt; instead of people<br/>
&gt; forcing it into the limelight via publicity stunts.<br/>
&gt; I hate seeing<br/>
&gt; interviews and articles published about lbing (and<br/>
&gt; geocaching too)-- too<br/>
&gt; bad it wasn't all learned word of mouth instead of<br/>
&gt; all this publicity. :o(<br/>
&gt; I really think it's to the detriment of boxing. It<br/>
&gt; may bring more people<br/>
&gt; into the hobby, but ...well... I dunno. Weighing<br/>
&gt; both sides, I think<br/>
&gt; publicity does more harm than good, as seen by the<br/>
&gt; State Park people now<br/>
&gt; getting a hold of it and wanting to regulate. I<br/>
&gt; mean... what's next? :o/<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The cat may be out of the bag but I DO think we<br/>
&gt; need to catch that cat<br/>
&gt; and stuff it back in... or else we're going to be<br/>
&gt; regulated more and more<br/>
&gt; and more until the hobby is forced to go the way of<br/>
&gt; the dodo, or morph into<br/>
&gt; something it's not. IMHO, permits from the state are<br/>
&gt; just one more step<br/>
&gt; down that slippery slope of hybridization.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ~Trailhoundz<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;But the secret is out and letterboxing is<br/>
&gt; exploding. Just the Girl Scout<br/>
&gt; letterboxing/geocaching badge alone has encouraged<br/>
&gt; hundreds of people to<br/>
&gt; join in. But the cat is out of the bag when state<br/>
&gt; park people are now<br/>
&gt; contacting Ryan at AQ or webmasters at LBNA.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1905800577">I think the intention is that you list a box you don't plan to <br/>
replace as "retired," if you do plan to replace it it's "missing." <br/>
The thing that drives me nuts is that there doesn't seem to be a way <br/>
to label stuff that way on lbna.  So when I look at my local boxes <br/>
there, there are a ton of boxes listed in Niagara county that aren't <br/>
really there because the folks who planted them pulled their boxes <br/>
when they moved out of the area.  The planters (Team Dakota) were <br/>
responsible and changed the clues to say that the boxes were no <br/>
longer there but had been pulled, I just wish lbna had a way for them <br/>
to list them as "retired" or whatever, so I could eliminate them from <br/>
my search.  I think there's a way I can mark to ignore them, but in <br/>
this particular instance Team Dakota has moved back to town and <br/>
indicated that they may put a couple of them back, so if I mark to <br/>
ignore them, then there's no way for me to know if they put the clue <br/>
back at some point.  That's why I like that AQ has a way for the <br/>
PLANTER to update the status of the box.  Yes, I'm sure there's a <br/>
clutter of missing and retired clues on the AQ database, but since I <br/>
never see them, I'm fine with that.  I love that I can eliminate <br/>
those from my search and only get listings for boxes that have some <br/>
likely-hood of being there.<br/>
<br/>
Now the thing that really bugs me is when I find a clue for a box <br/>
that lists the last actual find as over a year ago, and the most <br/>
recent as all being attempts, but the planter doesn't seem to have <br/>
checked it and admitted that it's gone.  I wasted a lot of time <br/>
looking for obviously missing rest stop boxes a few months ago.  Lock <br/>
Wench pointed out to me that if you aren't able to check a box right <br/>
away because you aren't going to be near it, but a couple of finders <br/>
have told you it's missing, you can always list it as "unknown" until <br/>
you're able to check for sure.  I think this is really responsible on <br/>
the part of the planter, and love that the biggest planter is so good <br/>
about keeping on top of the status of all her boxes!  I think <br/>
maintaining over 200 boxes sounds like a nightmare!  Go Wenchy!<br/>

p.s. The only box I've just deleted is one that went missing before <br/>
anyone found it, so it didn't affect anybody's found count, and I <br/>
don't care if my plant count is only actually existing plants and <br/>
things I chose to retire.</div>
