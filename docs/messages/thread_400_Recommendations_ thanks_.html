<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Buggylou,</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Glad you made it to the Left Coast. It's 
very different from the East, isn't it?</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">But, no! Western Blue Jays are just extra 
friendly and curious -- not loud and obnoxious like the ones you're used 
to. He just wanted to be friends...</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Now that you've done LA, you need to visit 
the Other Half of California in the North: San Francisco. </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You can buy a loaf of bread here at a 
store without getting on a freeway and sitting in traffic, you don't 
need an agent calling you on your cell phone, no pressure to be 'fabulous' 
in a Hollywood style, and the city is far more aesthetically beautiful and 
breathtaking. </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">In fact, you can be whoever you want 
to be and do and wear whatever you want here in the Bay Area. People won't judge 
you. Your zodiac sign is more important to others than how much money you make 
or the car you drive. </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It can be quirky, and eccentric, and 
diverse, and at the same time, you meet really fascinating people with great 
life stories. As for clothing outfits and hair styles -- every day has a 
bit of Halloween in it.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Well, yes,  there is the fog that 
makes July chilly -- but then, I don't have screens on my windows, because we 
have very, very few mosquitoes. I get about 3 bites a year until I fly to Utica 
in July. They hover in huge masses at the airport, darkening the sky, just 
waiting to dive for my veins!</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">What do you think, Lisascenic, across the 
Bay, over there in Oakland and Berkeley? What's your choice? LA or 
SF?</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></font></strong> </div>
<div><strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Paul in SF and not 
LA</font></strong></div>

What do you think, Lisascenic, across the Bay, over there in Oakland<br/>
and Berkeley? What's your choice? LA or SF?<br/>
<br/>
I've only been to LA once, and it was a rotten trip for reasons that<br/>
are long-past enough to be damned funny, now.  (I'm still not speaking<br/>
to *that* ex-boyfriend, though...)<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet you met up with a jay, and not a bluebird, Buggylou.  Jays<br/>
are cheeky little beasts.  Eastern Blue Jays will attack housecats,<br/>
and steal outdoor kibble.  The Stellars Jay is a sweetheart of mine,<br/>
because he's so punk and such a bad-ass.  (See, I still don't have a<br/>
lot of sense regarding the creatures I lose my heart to!)<br/>
<br/>
Is this your culprit?<br/>
<a href="http://www.neahkahnie.net/wildlife.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.neahkahnie.net/wildlife.htm</a><br/>

I actually have the Stellars Jay on my to-carve list.  He's a cousing<br/>
of the raven, who is also known a naughty bird!<br/>
