<div>I really don't see why you can't understand this. Everyone made it as clear as they could that they think the idea of a patch is great, hence they think that   <font face="Courier New"> "2 items (a t-shirt and/or a patch as a "public" display item)" are great. </font>And it would seem from the posts I've seen, that everyone made it clear that they preferred Sprite's design to a new and different one, regardless of who might design it. It seemed to me that people found the poll confusing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only thing that would have to be added for a patch is some colors, since her design is a line drawing. You seem to be taking this personally and you have no reason to do that.  You presented the idea of a different design and it was not a popular idea. You shouldn't get mad and take that personally. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm sure it :::would::: have been fun to design a patch and I think that's what you're made about. *You* wanted to design one and seem to be pouting  because we want to keep the one we have. That's not fair to Sprite or to the group as a whole. Or to yourself really. You're getting all stressed out over the fact that you sent an idea up the flagpole and it didn't fly.  I've read this over several times and now I'm going to hit send. I wasn't going to say anything before, but after your last post I had to say something. Your little jab at the group is uncalled for. </div>
