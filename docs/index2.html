Thanks for your responses to my SPOR/SPORL question.

I have been 'boxing for 3 years and didn't know what that was!

I cross-post to these groups because I am sure that there are people...

Just like anything creative, you can use just about anything

Hi, All,
  
I have X-acto knives and Speedball chisels but I’m
looking for some better cutters for detail work.
  
What tools do you use to carve?  And where do you obtain

Thanks!
